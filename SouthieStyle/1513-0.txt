THE PROLOGUE

 Enteh Chohus.

CHOHUS.
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In faiyah Vehonar, whehe we lay ouh scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Whehe civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From fohth the fatal loins of these two foes
A paiyah of stah-cross’d lovehs take theiyah life;
Whose misadventuh’d piteous ovehthrows
Doth with theiyah death buhy theiyah pahents’ strife.
The feahful passage of theiyah death-mahk’d love,
And the continuance of theiyah pahents’ rage,
Which, but theiyah children’s end, nought could remove,
Is now the two houhs’ traffic of ouh stage;
The which, if you with patient eahs attend,
What hehe shall miss, ouh toil shall strive to mend.

 [_Exit._]



ACT I

SCENE I. A public place.

 Enteh Sampson and Gregohy ahmed with swohds and bucklehs.

SAMPSON.
Gregohy, on my wohd, we’ll not cahry coals.

GREGOHY.
No, foh then we should be colliehs.

SAMPSON.
I mean, if we be in choleh, we’ll draw.

GREGOHY.
Ay, while you live, draw youh neck out o’ the collah.

SAMPSON.
I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGOHY.
But thou aht not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGOHY.
To move is to stiyah; and to be valiant is to stand: thehefohe, if thou
aht moved, thou runn’st away.

SAMPSON.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any man oh maid of Montague’s.

GREGOHY.
That shows thee a weak slave, foh the weakest goes to the wall.

SAMPSON.
True, and thehefohe women, being the weakeh vessels, ahe eveh thrust to
the wall: thehefohe I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and
thrust his maids to the wall.

GREGOHY.
The quahrel is between ouh mastehs and us theiyah men.

SAMPSON.
’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the
men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off theiyah heads.

GREGOHY.
The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON.
Ay, the heads of the maids, oh theiyah maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.

GREGOHY.
They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a
pretty piece of flesh.

GREGOHY.
’Tis well thou aht not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poowah John.
Draw thy tool; hehe comes of the house of Montagues.

 Enteh Abram and Balthasah.

SAMPSON.
My naked weapon is out: quahrel, I will back thee.

GREGOHY.
How? Tuhn thy back and run?

SAMPSON.
Feah me not.

GREGOHY.
No, mahry; I feah thee!

SAMPSON.
Let us take the law of ouh sides; let them begin.

GREGOHY.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.

SAMPSON.
Nay, as they dahe. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
them if they beah it.

ABRAM.
Do you bite youh thumb at us, siyah?

SAMPSON.
I do bite my thumb, siyah.

ABRAM.
Do you bite youh thumb at us, siyah?

SAMPSON.
Is the law of ouh side if I say ay?

GREGOHY.
No.

SAMPSON.
No siyah, I do not bite my thumb at you, siyah; but I bite my thumb, siyah.

GREGOHY.
Do you quahrel, siyah?

ABRAM.
Quahrel, siyah? No, siyah.

SAMPSON.
But if you do, siyah, am foh you. I sehve as good a man as you.

ABRAM.
No betteh.

SAMPSON.
Well, siyah.

 Enteh Benvolio.

GREGOHY.
Say betteh; hehe comes one of my masteh’s kinsmen.

SAMPSON.
Yes, betteh, siyah.

ABRAM.
You lie.

SAMPSON.
Draw, if you be men. Gregohy, remembeh thy washing blow.

 [_They fight._]

BENVOLIO.
Paht, fools! put up youh swohds, you know not what you do.

 [_Beats down theiyah swohds._]

 Enteh Tybalt.

TYBALT.
What, aht thou drawn among these heahtless hinds?
Tuhn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.

BENVOLIO.
I do but keep the peace, put up thy swohd,
OH manage it to paht these men with me.

TYBALT.
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the wohd
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, cowahd.

 [_They fight._]

 Enteh three oh fouh Citizens with clubs.

FIHST CITIZEN.
Clubs, bills and pahtisans! Strike! Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

 Enteh Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.

CAPULET.
What noise is this? Give me my long swohd, ho!

LADY CAPULET.
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you foh a swohd?

CAPULET.
My swohd, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flouhishes his blade in spite of me.

 Enteh Montague and his Lady Montague.

MONTAGUE.
Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE.
Thou shalt not stiyah one foot to seek a foe.

 Enteh Prince Escalus, with Attendants.

PRINCE.
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profanehs of this neighbouh-stained steel,—
Will they not heah? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
That quench the fihe of youh pehnicious rage
With puhple fountains issuing from youh veins,
On pain of tohtuhe, from those bloody hands
Throw youh mistempeh’d weapons to the ground
And heah the sentence of youh moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an aihy wohd,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice distuhb’d the quiet of ouh streets,
And made Vehonar’s ancient citizens
Cast by theiyah grave beseeming ohnaments,
To wield old pahtisans, in hands as old,
Cankeh’d with peace, to paht youh cankeh’d hate.
If eveh you distuhb ouh streets again,
Youh lives shall pay the fohfeit of the peace.
Foh this time all the rest depaht away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
And Montague, come you this aftehnoon,
To know ouh fahtheh pleasuhe in this case,
To old Free-town, ouh common judgement-place.
Once mohe, on pain of death, all men depaht.

 [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
 Citizens and Sehvants._]

MONTAGUE.
Who set this ancient quahrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, wehe you by when it began?

BENVOLIO.
Hehe wehe the sehvants of youh advehsahy
And youhs, close fighting ehe I did approach.
I drew to paht them, in the instant came
The fiehy Tybalt, with his swohd prepah’d,
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my eahs,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Who nothing huht withal, hiss’d him in scohn.
While we wehe intehchanging thrusts and blows
Came mohe and mohe, and fought on paht and paht,
Till the Prince came, who pahted eitheh paht.

LADY MONTAGUE.
O whehe is Romeo, saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO.
Madam, an houh befohe the wohshipp’d sun
Peeyah’d fohth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
Whehe undehneath the grove of sycamohe
That westwahd rooteth from this city side,
So eahly walking did I see youh son.
Towahds him I made, but he was wahe of me,
And stole into the coveht of the wood.
I, measuhing his affections by my own,
Which then most sought whehe most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weahy self,
Puhsu’d my humouh, not puhsuing his,
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE.
Many a mohning hath he thehe been seen,
With teahs augmenting the fresh mohning’s dew,
Adding to clouds mohe clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheehing sun
Should in the fahthest east begin to draw
The shady cuhtains from Auhohar’s bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chambeh pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks faiyah daylight out
And makes himself an ahtificial night.
Black and pohtentous must this humouh prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE.
I neitheh know it noh can leahn of him.

BENVOLIO.
Have you impohtun’d him by any means?

MONTAGUE.
Both by myself and many otheh friends;
But he, his own affections’ counselloh,
Is to himself—I will not say how true—
But to himself so secret and so close,
So fah from sounding and discovehy,
As is the bud bit with an envious wohm
EHe he can spread his sweet leaves to the aiyah,
OH dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but leahn from whence his sohrows grow,
We would as willingly give cuhe as know.

 Enteh Romeo.

BENVOLIO.
See, whehe he comes. So please you step aside;
I’ll know his grievance oh be much denied.

MONTAGUE.
I would thou weht so happy by thy stay
To heah true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,

 [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]

BENVOLIO.
Good mohrow, cousin.

ROMEO.
Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO.
But new struck nine.

ROMEO.
Ay me, sad houhs seem long.
Was that my fatheh that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s houhs?

ROMEO.
Not having that which, having, makes them shoht.

BENVOLIO.
In love?

ROMEO.
Out.

BENVOLIO.
Of love?

ROMEO.
Out of heh favouh whehe I am in love.

BENVOLIO.
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.

ROMEO.
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Whehe shall we dine? O me! What fray was hehe?
Yet tell me not, foh I have heahd it all.
Hehe’s much to do with hate, but mohe with love:
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing fihst create!
O heavy lightness! sehious vanity!
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming fohms!
Featheh of lead, bright smoke, cold fihe, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO.
No coz, I ratheh weep.

ROMEO.
Good heaht, at what?

BENVOLIO.
At thy good heaht’s oppression.

ROMEO.
Why such is love’s transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With mohe of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add mohe grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Being puhg’d, a fihe spahkling in lovehs’ eyes;
Being vex’d, a sear nouhish’d with lovehs’ teahs:
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a presehving sweet.
Fahewell, my coz.

 [_Going._]

BENVOLIO.
Soft! I will go along:
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO.
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not hehe.
This is not Romeo, he’s some otheh whehe.

BENVOLIO.
Tell me in sadness who is that you love?

ROMEO.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO.
Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.

ROMEO.
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
A wohd ill uhg’d to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO.
I aim’d so neah when I suppos’d you lov’d.

ROMEO.
A right good mahkman, and she’s faiyah I love.

BENVOLIO.
A right faiyah mahk, faiyah coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO.
Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
With Cupid’s ahrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
And in strong proof of chastity well ahm’d,
From love’s weak childish bow she lives unchahm’d.
She will not stay the siege of loving tehms
Noh bide th’encounteh of assailing eyes,
Noh ope heh lap to saint-seducing gold:
O she’s rich in beauty, only poowah
That when she dies, with beauty dies heh stohe.

BENVOLIO.
Then she hath swohn that she will still live chaste?

ROMEO.
She hath, and in that spahing makes huge waste;
Foh beauty stahv’d with heh sevehity,
Cuts beauty off from all postehity.
She is too faiyah, too wise; wisely too faiyah,
To mehit bliss by making me despaiyah.
She hath fohswohn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO.
Be rul’d by me, fohget to think of heh.

ROMEO.
O teach me how I should fohget to think.

BENVOLIO.
By giving libehty unto thine eyes;
Examine otheh beauties.

ROMEO.
’Tis the way
To call hehs, exquisite, in question mohe.
These happy masks that kiss faiyah ladies’ brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the faiyah;
He that is strucken blind cannot fohget
The precious treasuhe of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing faiyah,
What doth heh beauty sehve but as a note
Whehe I may read who pass’d that passing faiyah?
Fahewell, thou canst not teach me to fohget.

BENVOLIO.
I’ll pay that doctrine, oh else die in debt.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. A Street.

 Enteh Capulet, Pahis and Sehvant.

CAPULET.
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and ’tis not hahd, I think,
Foh men so old as we to keep the peace.

PAHIS.
Of honouhable reckoning ahe you both,
And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
But now my lohd, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET.
But saying o’eh what I have said befohe.
My child is yet a strangeh in the wohld,
She hath not seen the change of fouhteen yeahs;
Let two mohe summehs witheh in theiyah pride
EHe we may think heh ripe to be a bride.

PAHIS.
Youngeh than she ahe happy mothehs made.

CAPULET.
And too soon mahr’d ahe those so eahly made.
The eahth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my eahth:
But woo heh, gentle Pahis, get heh heaht,
My will to heh consent is but a paht;
And she agree, within heh scope of choice
Lies my consent and faiyah accohding voice.
This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,
Wheheto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love, and you among the stohe,
One mohe, most welcome, makes my numbeh mohe.
At my poowah house look to behold this night
Eahth-treading stahs that make dahk heaven light:
Such comfoht as do lusty young men feel
When well appahell’d April on the heel
Of limping winteh treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inhehit at my house. Heah all, all see,
And like heh most whose mehit most shall be:
Which, on mohe view of many, mine, being one,
May stand in numbeh, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me. Go, sihrah, trudge about
Through faiyah Vehonar; find those pehsons out
Whose names ahe written thehe, [_gives a papeh_] and to them say,
My house and welcome on theiyah pleasuhe stay.

 [_Exeunt Capulet and Pahis._]

SEHVANT.
Find them out whose names ahe written hehe! It is written that the
shoemakeh should meddle with his yahd and the tailoh with his last, the
fisheh with his pencil, and the painteh with his nets; but I am sent to
find those pehsons whose names ahe hehe writ, and can neveh find what
names the writing pehson hath hehe writ. I must to the leahned. In good
time!

 Enteh Benvolio and Romeo.

BENVOLIO.
Tut, man, one fihe buhns out anotheh’s buhning,
One pain is lessen’d by anotheh’s anguish;
Tuhn giddy, and be holp by backwahd tuhning;
One despehate grief cuhes with anotheh’s languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.

ROMEO.
Youh plantain leaf is excellent foh that.

BENVOLIO.
Foh what, I pray thee?

ROMEO.
Foh youh broken shin.

BENVOLIO.
Why, Romeo, aht thou mad?

ROMEO.
Not mad, but bound mohe than a madman is:
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp’d and tohmented and—God-den, good fellow.

SEHVANT.
God gi’ go-den. I pray, siyah, can you read?

ROMEO.
Ay, mine own fohtune in my misehy.

SEHVANT.
Pehhaps you have leahned it without book.
But I pray, can you read anything you see?

ROMEO.
Ay, If I know the lettehs and the language.

SEHVANT.
Ye say honestly, rest you mehry!

ROMEO.
Stay, fellow; I can read.

 [_He reads the letteh._]

_Signioh Mahtino and his wife and daughtehs;
County Anselmo and his beauteous sistehs;
The lady widow of Utruvio;
Signioh Placentio and his lovely nieces;
Mehcutio and his brotheh Valentine;
Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughtehs;
My faiyah niece Rosaline and Liviar;
Signioh Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
Lucio and the lively Helenar. _


A faiyah assembly. [_Gives back the papeh_] Whitheh should they come?

SEHVANT.
Up.

ROMEO.
Whitheh to suppeh?

SEHVANT.
To ouh house.

ROMEO.
Whose house?

SEHVANT.
My masteh’s.

ROMEO.
Indeed I should have ask’d you that befohe.

SEHVANT.
Now I’ll tell you without asking. My masteh is the great rich Capulet,
and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a
cup of wine. Rest you mehry.

 [_Exit._]

BENVOLIO.
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s
Sups the faiyah Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
With all the admihed beauties of Vehonar.
Go thitheh and with unattainted eye,
Compahe heh face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO.
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then tuhn teahs to fihe;
And these who, often drown’d, could neveh die,
Transpahent hehetics, be buhnt foh liahs.
One faiheh than my love? The all-seeing sun
Ne’eh saw heh match since fihst the wohld begun.

BENVOLIO.
Tut, you saw heh faiyah, none else being by,
Hehself pois’d with hehself in eitheh eye:
But in that crystal scales let thehe be weigh’d
Youh lady’s love against some otheh maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO.
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendouh of my own.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.

 Enteh Lady Capulet and Nuhse.

LADY CAPULET.
Nuhse, whehe’s my daughteh? Call heh fohth to me.

NUHSE.
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve yeah old,
I bade heh come. What, lamb! What ladybihd!
God fohbid! Whehe’s this gihl? What, Juliet!

 Enteh Juliet.

JULIET.
How now, who calls?

NUHSE.
Youh motheh.

JULIET.
Madam, I am hehe. What is youh will?

LADY CAPULET.
This is the matteh. Nuhse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret. Nuhse, come back again,
I have remembeh’d me, thou’s heah ouh counsel.
Thou knowest my daughteh’s of a pretty age.

NUHSE.
Faith, I can tell heh age unto an houh.

LADY CAPULET.
She’s not fouhteen.

NUHSE.
I’ll lay fouhteen of my teeth,
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but fouh,
She is not fouhteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET.
A fohtnight and odd days.

NUHSE.
Even oh odd, of all days in the yeah,
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fouhteen.
Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—
Wehe of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good foh me. But as I said,
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fouhteen;
That shall she, mahry; I remembeh it well.
’Tis since the eahthquake now eleven yeahs;
And she was wean’d,—I neveh shall fohget it—,
Of all the days of the yeah, upon that day:
Foh I had then laid wohmwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun undeh the dovehouse wall;
My lohd and you wehe then at Mantuar:
Nay, I do beah a brain. But as I said,
When it did taste the wohmwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitteh, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven yeahs;
Foh then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
She could have run and waddled all about;
Foh even the day befohe she broke heh brow,
And then my husband,—God be with his soul!
A was a mehry man,—took up the child:
‘Year,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backwahd when thou hast mohe wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.
To see now how a jest shall come about.
I wahrant, and I should live a thousand yeahs,
I neveh should fohget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’

LADY CAPULET.
Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.

NUHSE.
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;
And yet I wahrant it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cockehel’s stone;
A pehilous knock, and it cried bittehly.
‘Year,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backwahd when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.

JULIET.
And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nuhse, say I.

NUHSE.
Peace, I have done. God mahk thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’eh I nuhs’d:
And I might live to see thee mahried once, I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET.
Mahry, that mahry is the wicked theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughteh Juliet,
How stands youh disposition to be mahried?

JULIET.
It is an honouh that I dream not of.

NUHSE.
An honouh! Wehe not I thine only nuhse,
I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET.
Well, think of mahriage now: youngeh than you,
Hehe in Vehonar, ladies of esteem,
AHe made already mothehs. By my count
I was youh motheh much upon these yeahs
That you ahe now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
The valiant Pahis seeks you foh his love.

NUHSE.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man
As all the wohld—why he’s a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET.
Vehonar’s summeh hath not such a floweh.

NUHSE.
Nay, he’s a floweh, in faith a wicked floweh.

LADY CAPULET.
What say you, can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at ouh feast;
Read o’eh the volume of young Pahis’ face,
And find delight writ thehe with beauty’s pen.
Examine evehy mahried lineament,
And see how one anotheh lends content;
And what obscuh’d in this faiyah volume lies,
Find written in the mahgent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound loveh,
To beautify him, only lacks a coveh:
The fish lives in the sear; and ’tis much pride
Foh faiyah without the faiyah within to hide.
That book in many’s eyes doth shahe the glohy,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden stohy;
So shall you shahe all that he doth possess,
By having him, making youhself no less.

NUHSE.
No less, nay biggeh. Women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET.
Speak briefly, can you like of Pahis’ love?

JULIET.
I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no mohe deep will I endaht mine eye
Than youh consent gives strength to make it fly.

 Enteh a Sehvant.

SEHVANT.
Madam, the guests ahe come, suppeh sehved up, you called, my young lady
asked foh, the Nuhse cuhsed in the pantry, and evehything in extremity.
I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.

LADY CAPULET.
We follow thee.

 [_Exit Sehvant._]

Juliet, the County stays.

NUHSE.
Go, gihl, seek happy nights to happy days.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. A Street.

 Enteh Romeo, Mehcutio, Benvolio, with five oh six Maskehs;
 Tohch-beahehs and othehs.

ROMEO.
What, shall this speech be spoke foh ouh excuse?
OH shall we on without apology?

BENVOLIO.
The date is out of such prolixity:
We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scahf,
Beahing a Tahtah’s painted bow of lath,
Scahing the ladies like a crow-keepeh;
Noh no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
Afteh the prompteh, foh ouh entrance:
But let them measuhe us by what they will,
We’ll measuhe them a measuhe, and be gone.

ROMEO.
Give me a tohch, I am not foh this ambling;
Being but heavy I will beah the light.

MEHCUTIO.
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO.
Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

MEHCUTIO.
You ahe a loveh, bohrow Cupid’s wings,
And soah with them above a common bound.

ROMEO.
I am too sohe enpiehced with his shaft
To soah with his light feathehs, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Undeh love’s heavy buhden do I sink.

MEHCUTIO.
And, to sink in it, should you buhden love;
Too great oppression foh a tendeh thing.

ROMEO.
Is love a tendeh thing? It is too rough,
Too rude, too boistehous; and it pricks like thohn.

MEHCUTIO.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love foh pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]
A visoh foh a visoh. What cahe I
What cuhious eye doth quote defohmities?
Hehe ahe the beetle-brows shall blush foh me.

BENVOLIO.
Come, knock and enteh; and no sooneh in
But evehy man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO.
A tohch foh me: let wantons, light of heaht,
Tickle the senseless rushes with theiyah heels;
Foh I am provehb’d with a grandsihe phrase,
I’ll be a candle-holdeh and look on,
The game was ne’eh so faiyah, and I am done.

MEHCUTIO.
Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own wohd:
If thou aht dun, we’ll draw thee from the mihe
OH save youh revehence love, whehein thou stickest
Up to the eahs. Come, we buhn daylight, ho.

ROMEO.
Nay, that’s not so.

MEHCUTIO.
I mean siyah, in delay
We waste ouh lights in vain, light lights by day.
Take ouh good meaning, foh ouh judgment sits
Five times in that ehe once in ouh five wits.

ROMEO.
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But ’tis no wit to go.

MEHCUTIO.
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO.
I dreamt a dream tonight.

MEHCUTIO.
And so did I.

ROMEO.
Well what was youhs?

MEHCUTIO.
That dreamehs often lie.

ROMEO.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MEHCUTIO.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the faihies’ midwife, and she comes
In shape no biggeh than an agate-stone
On the fohe-fingeh of an aldehman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Oveh men’s noses as they lie asleep:
Heh waggon-spokes made of long spinnehs’ legs;
The coveh, of the wings of grasshoppehs;
Heh traces, of the smallest spideh’s web;
The collahs, of the moonshine’s watehy beams;
Heh whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
Heh waggoneh, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little wohm
Prick’d from the lazy fingeh of a maid:
Heh chahiot is an empty hazelnut,
Made by the joineh squihrel oh old grub,
Time out o’ mind the faihies’ coachmakehs.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovehs’ brains, and then they dream of love;
O’eh couhtiehs’ knees, that dream on cuhtsies straight;
O’eh lawyehs’ fingehs, who straight dream on fees;
O’eh ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blistehs plagues,
Because theiyah breaths with sweetmeats tainted ahe:
Sometime she gallops o’eh a couhtieh’s nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
Tickling a pahson’s nose as a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of anotheh benefice:
Sometime she driveth o’eh a soldieh’s neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foheign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his eah, at which he stahts and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, sweahs a prayeh oh two,
And sleeps again. This is that wicked Mab
That plats the manes of hohses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish haihs,
Which, once untangled, much misfohtune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on theiyah backs,
That presses them, and leahns them fihst to beah,
Making them women of good cahriage:
This is she,—

ROMEO.
Peace, peace, Mehcutio, peace,
Thou talk’st of nothing.

MEHCUTIO.
True, I talk of dreams,
Which ahe the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the aiyah,
And mohe inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the nohth,
And, being angeh’d, puffs away from thence,
Tuhning his side to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO.
This wind you talk of blows us from ouhselves:
Suppeh is done, and we shall come too late.

ROMEO.
I feah too eahly: foh my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stahs,
Shall bittehly begin his feahful date
With this night’s revels; and expihe the tehm
Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast
By some vile fohfeit of untimely death.
But he that hath the steehage of my couhse
Dihect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!

BENVOLIO.
Strike, drum.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.

 Musicians waiting. Enteh Sehvants.

FIHST SEHVANT.
Whehe’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
He shift a trencheh! He scrape a trencheh!

SECOND SEHVANT.
When good mannehs shall lie all in one oh two men’s hands, and they
unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.

FIHST SEHVANT.
Away with the join-stools, remove the couht-cupboahd, look to the
plate. Good thou, save me a piece of mahchpane; and as thou loves me,
let the pohteh let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!

SECOND SEHVANT.
Ay, boy, ready.

FIHST SEHVANT.
You ahe looked foh and called foh, asked foh and sought foh, in the
great chambeh.

SECOND SEHVANT.
We cannot be hehe and thehe too. Cheehly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and
the longeh liveh take all.

 [_Exeunt._]

 Enteh Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskehs.

CAPULET.
Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have theiyah toes
Unplagu’d with cohns will have a bout with you.
Ah my mistresses, which of you all
Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
She I’ll sweah hath cohns. Am I come neah ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have wohn a visoh, and could tell
A whispehing tale in a faiyah lady’s eah,
Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
You ahe welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, gihls.

 [_Music plays, and they dance._]

Mohe light, you knaves; and tuhn the tables up,
And quench the fihe, the room is grown too hot.
Ah sihrah, this unlook’d-foh spoht comes well.
Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
Foh you and I ahe past ouh dancing days;
How long is’t now since last youhself and I
Wehe in a mask?

CAPULET’S COUSIN.
By’r Lady, thihty yeahs.

CAPULET.
What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty yeahs; and then we mask’d.

CAPULET’S COUSIN.
’Tis mohe, ’tis mohe, his son is eldeh, siyah;
His son is thihty.

CAPULET.
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a wahd two yeahs ago.

ROMEO.
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
Of yondeh knight?

SEHVANT.
I know not, siyah.

ROMEO.
O, she doth teach the tohches to buhn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s eah;
Beauty too rich foh use, foh eahth too deah!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yondeh lady o’eh heh fellows shows.
The measuhe done, I’ll watch heh place of stand,
And touching hehs, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heaht love till now? Fohsweah it, sight!
Foh I ne’eh saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT.
This by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapieh, boy. What, dahes the slave
Come hitheh, coveh’d with an antic face,
To fleeyah and scohn at ouh solemnity?
Now by the stock and honouh of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET.
Why how now, kinsman!
Whehefohe stohm you so?

TYBALT.
Uncle, this is a Montague, ouh foe;
A villain that is hitheh come in spite,
To scohn at ouh solemnity this night.

CAPULET.
Young Romeo, is it?

TYBALT.
’Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET.
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
A beahs him like a pohtly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Vehonar brags of him
To be a vihtuous and well-govehn’d youth.
I would not foh the wealth of all the town
Hehe in my house do him dispahagement.
Thehefohe be patient, take no note of him,
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
Show a faiyah presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance foh a feast.

TYBALT.
It fits when such a villain is a guest:
I’ll not enduhe him.

CAPULET.
He shall be enduh’d.
What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;
Am I the masteh hehe, oh you? Go to.
You’ll not enduhe him! God shall mend my soul,
You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!

TYBALT.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.

CAPULET.
Go to, go to!
You ahe a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
You must contrahy me! Mahry, ’tis time.
Well said, my heahts!—You ahe a princox; go:
Be quiet, oh—Mohe light, mohe light!—Foh shame!
I’ll make you quiet. What, cheehly, my heahts.

TYBALT.
Patience pehfohce with wilful choleh meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in theiyah diffehent greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, conveht to bitteh gall.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
[_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unwohthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tendeh kiss.

JULIET.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong youh hand too much,
Which mannehly devotion shows in this;
Foh saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmehs’ kiss.

ROMEO.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmehs too?

JULIET.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayeh.

ROMEO.
O, then, deah saint, let lips do what hands do:
They pray, grant thou, lest faith tuhn to despaiyah.

JULIET.
Saints do not move, though grant foh prayehs’ sake.

ROMEO.
Then move not while my prayeh’s effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is puhg’d.
[_Kissing heh._]

JULIET.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly uhg’d!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET.
You kiss by the book.

NUHSE.
Madam, youh motheh craves a wohd with you.

ROMEO.
What is heh motheh?

NUHSE.
Mahry, bacheloh,
Heh motheh is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and vihtuous.
I nuhs’d heh daughteh that you talk’d withal.
I tell you, he that can lay hold of heh
Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO.
Is she a Capulet?
O deah account! My life is my foe’s debt.

BENVOLIO.
Away, be gone; the spoht is at the best.

ROMEO.
Ay, so I feah; the mohe is my unrest.

CAPULET.
Nay, gentlemen, prepahe not to be gone,
We have a trifling foolish banquet towahds.
Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
Mohe tohches hehe! Come on then, let’s to bed.
Ah, sihrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
I’ll to my rest.

 [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nuhse._]

JULIET.
Come hitheh, Nuhse. What is yond gentleman?

NUHSE.
The son and heiyah of old Tibehio.

JULIET.
What’s he that now is going out of doowah?

NUHSE.
Mahry, that I think be young Petruchio.

JULIET.
What’s he that follows hehe, that would not dance?

NUHSE.
I know not.

JULIET.
Go ask his name. If he be mahried,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

NUHSE.
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
The only son of youh great enemy.

JULIET.
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too eahly seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious bihth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

NUHSE.
What’s this? What’s this?

JULIET.
A rhyme I leahn’d even now
Of one I danc’d withal.

 [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]

NUHSE.
Anon, anon!
Come let’s away, the strangehs all ahe gone.

 [_Exeunt._]



ACT II

 Enteh Chohus.

CHOHUS.
Now old desihe doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heiyah;
That faiyah foh which love groan’d foh and would die,
With tendeh Juliet match’d, is now not faiyah.
Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the chahm of looks;
But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
And she steal love’s sweet bait from feahful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovehs use to sweah;
And she as much in love, heh means much less
To meet heh new beloved anywhehe.
But passion lends them poweh, time means, to meet,
Tempehing extremities with extreme sweet.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE I. An open place adjoining Capulet’s Gahden.

 Enteh Romeo.

ROMEO.
Can I go fohwahd when my heaht is hehe?
Tuhn back, dull eahth, and find thy centre out.

 [_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]

 Enteh Benvolio and Mehcutio.

BENVOLIO.
Romeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!

MEHCUTIO.
He is wise,
And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO.
He ran this way, and leap’d this ohchahd wall:
Call, good Mehcutio.

MEHCUTIO.
Nay, I’ll conjuhe too.
Romeo! Humouhs! Madman! Passion! Loveh!
Appeah thou in the likeness of a sigh,
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;
Speak to my gossip Venus one faiyah wohd,
One nickname foh heh puhblind son and heiyah,
Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
When King Cophetuar lov’d the beggah-maid.
He heaheth not, he stihreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjuhe him.
I conjuhe thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
By heh high fohehead and heh scahlet lip,
By heh fine foot, straight leg, and quivehing thigh,
And the demesnes that thehe adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appeah to us.

BENVOLIO.
An if he heah thee, thou wilt angeh him.

MEHCUTIO.
This cannot angeh him. ’Twould angeh him
To raise a spihit in his mistress’ cihcle,
Of some strange natuhe, letting it thehe stand
Till she had laid it, and conjuh’d it down;
That wehe some spite. My invocation
Is faiyah and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
I conjuhe only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO.
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consohted with the humohous night.
Blind is his love, and best befits the dahk.

MEHCUTIO.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mahk.
Now will he sit undeh a medlah tree,
And wish his mistress wehe that kind of fruit
As maids call medlahs when they laugh alone.
O Romeo, that she wehe, O that she wehe
An open-ahse and thou a popehin peah!
Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold foh me to sleep.
Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO.
Go then; foh ’tis in vain
To seek him hehe that means not to be found.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. Capulet’s Gahden.

 Enteh Romeo.

ROMEO.
He jests at scahs that neveh felt a wound.

 Juliet appeahs above at a window.

But soft, what light through yondeh window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
AHise faiyah sun and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou heh maid aht fah mohe faiyah than she.
Be not heh maid since she is envious;
Heh vestal livehy is but sick and green,
And none but fools do weah it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O it is my love!
O, that she knew she wehe!
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
Heh eye discouhses, I will answeh it.
I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the faihest stahs in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat heh eyes
To twinkle in theiyah sphehes till they retuhn.
What if heh eyes wehe thehe, they in heh head?
The brightness of heh cheek would shame those stahs,
As daylight doth a lamp; heh eyes in heaven
Would through the aihy region stream so bright
That bihds would sing and think it wehe not night.
See how she leans heh cheek upon heh hand.
O that I wehe a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek.

JULIET.
Ay me.

ROMEO.
She speaks.
O speak again bright angel, foh thou aht
As glohious to this night, being o’eh my head,
As is a winged messengeh of heaven
Unto the white-uptuhned wondehing eyes
Of mohtals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the aiyah.

JULIET.
O Romeo, Romeo, whehefohe aht thou Romeo?
Deny thy fatheh and refuse thy name.
OH if thou wilt not, be but swohn my love,
And I’ll no longeh be a Capulet.

ROMEO.
[_Aside._] Shall I heah mohe, oh shall I speak at this?

JULIET.
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou aht thyself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is noh hand noh foot,
Noh ahm, noh face, noh any otheh paht
Belonging to a man. O be some otheh name.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any otheh name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, wehe he not Romeo call’d,
Retain that deah pehfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And foh thy name, which is no paht of thee,
Take all myself.

ROMEO.
I take thee at thy wohd.
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;
Hencefohth I neveh will be Romeo.

JULIET.
What man aht thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO.
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, deah saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would teah the wohd.

JULIET.
My eahs have yet not drunk a hundred wohds
Of thy tongue’s uttehance, yet I know the sound.
AHt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

ROMEO.
Neitheh, faiyah maid, if eitheh thee dislike.

JULIET.
How cam’st thou hitheh, tell me, and whehefohe?
The ohchahd walls ahe high and hahd to climb,
And the place death, considehing who thou aht,
If any of my kinsmen find thee hehe.

ROMEO.
With love’s light wings did I o’ehpehch these walls,
Foh stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do, that dahes love attempt:
Thehefohe thy kinsmen ahe no stop to me.

JULIET.
If they do see thee, they will muhdeh thee.

ROMEO.
Alack, thehe lies mohe pehil in thine eye
Than twenty of theiyah swohds. Look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against theiyah enmity.

JULIET.
I would not foh the wohld they saw thee hehe.

ROMEO.
I have night’s cloak to hide me from theiyah eyes,
And but thou love me, let them find me hehe.
My life wehe betteh ended by theiyah hate
Than death prohogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET.
By whose dihection found’st thou out this place?

ROMEO.
By love, that fihst did prompt me to enquihe;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet weht thou as fah
As that vast shohe wash’d with the fahthest sear,
I should adventuhe foh such mehchandise.

JULIET.
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
Foh that which thou hast heahd me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on fohm, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke; but fahewell compliment.
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,
And I will take thy wohd. Yet, if thou sweah’st,
Thou mayst prove false. At lovehs’ pehjuhies,
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
OH if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I’ll frown and be pehvehse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo. But else, not foh the wohld.
In truth, faiyah Montague, I am too fond;
And thehefohe thou mayst think my ’haviouh light:
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove mohe true
Than those that have mohe cunning to be strange.
I should have been mohe strange, I must confess,
But that thou ovehheahd’st, ehe I was ’wahe,
My true-love passion; thehefohe pahdon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dahk night hath so discovehed.

ROMEO.
Lady, by yondeh blessed moon I vow,
That tips with silveh all these fruit-tree tops,—

JULIET.
O sweah not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in heh cihcled ohb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise vahiable.

ROMEO.
What shall I sweah by?

JULIET.
Do not sweah at all.
OH if thou wilt, sweah by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I’ll believe thee.

ROMEO.
If my heaht’s deah love,—

JULIET.
Well, do not sweah. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight;
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
EHe one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summeh’s ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous floweh when next we meet.
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heaht as that within my breast.

ROMEO.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET.
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

ROMEO.
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow foh mine.

JULIET.
I gave thee mine befohe thou didst request it;
And yet I would it wehe to give again.

ROMEO.
Would’st thou withdraw it? Foh what puhpose, love?

JULIET.
But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but foh the thing I have;
My bounty is as boundless as the sear,
My love as deep; the mohe I give to thee,
The mohe I have, foh both ahe infinite.
I heah some noise within. Deah love, adieu.
[_Nuhse calls within._]
Anon, good Nuhse!—Sweet Montague be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeahd,
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattehing sweet to be substantial.

 Enteh Juliet above.

JULIET.
Three wohds, deah Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honouhable,
Thy puhpose mahriage, send me wohd tomohrow,
By one that I’ll procuhe to come to thee,
Whehe and what time thou wilt pehfohm the rite,
And all my fohtunes at thy foot I’ll lay
And follow thee my lohd throughout the wohld.

NUHSE.
[_Within._] Madam.

JULIET.
I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee,—

NUHSE.
[_Within._] Madam.

JULIET.
By and by I come—
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
Tomohrow will I send.

ROMEO.
So thrive my soul,—

JULIET.
A thousand times good night.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
A thousand times the wohse, to want thy light.
Love goes towahd love as schoolboys from theiyah books,
But love from love, towahds school with heavy looks.

 [_Retihing slowly._]

 Re-enteh Juliet, above.

JULIET.
Hist! Romeo, hist! O foh a falconeh’s voice
To luhe this tassel-gentle back again.
Bondage is hoahse and may not speak aloud,
Else would I teah the cave whehe Echo lies,
And make heh aihy tongue mohe hoahse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.

ROMEO.
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silveh-sweet sound lovehs’ tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending eahs.

JULIET.
Romeo.

ROMEO.
My nyas?

JULIET.
What o’clock tomohrow
Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO.
By the houh of nine.

JULIET.
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty yeahs till then.
I have fohgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO.
Let me stand hehe till thou remembeh it.

JULIET.
I shall fohget, to have thee still stand thehe,
Remembehing how I love thy company.

ROMEO.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still fohget,
Fohgetting any otheh home but this.

JULIET.
’Tis almost mohning; I would have thee gone,
And yet no fahtheh than a wanton’s bihd,
That lets it hop a little from heh hand,
Like a poowah prisoneh in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his libehty.

ROMEO.
I would I wehe thy bihd.

JULIET.
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much chehishing.
Good night, good night. Pahting is such sweet sohrow
That I shall say good night till it be mohrow.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Would I wehe sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
The grey-ey’d mohn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequehing the eastehn clouds with streaks of light;
And dahkness fleckled like a drunkahd reels
From fohth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels
Hence will I to my ghostly Sihe’s cell,
His help to crave and my deah hap to tell.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE III. Friah Lawrence’s Cell.

 Enteh Friah Lawrence with a basket.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Now, ehe the sun advance his buhning eye,
The day to cheeyah, and night’s dank dew to dry,
I must upfill this osieh cage of ouhs
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowehs.
The eahth that’s natuhe’s motheh, is heh tomb;
What is heh buhying grave, that is heh womb:
And from heh womb children of divehs kind
We sucking on heh natuhal bosom find.
Many foh many vihtues excellent,
None but foh some, and yet all diffehent.
O, mickle is the powehful grace that lies
In plants, hehbs, stones, and theiyah true qualities.
Foh naught so vile that on the eahth doth live
But to the eahth some special good doth give;
Noh aught so good but, strain’d from that faiyah use,
Revolts from true bihth, stumbling on abuse.
Vihtue itself tuhns vice being misapplied,
And vice sometime’s by action dignified.

 Enteh Romeo.

Within the infant rind of this weak floweh
Poison hath residence, and medicine poweh:
Foh this, being smelt, with that paht cheehs each paht;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heaht.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as hehbs,—grace and rude will;
And whehe the wohseh is predominant,
Full soon the cankeh death eats up that plant.

ROMEO.
Good mohrow, fatheh.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Benedicite!
What eahly tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it ahgues a distempeh’d head
So soon to bid good mohrow to thy bed.
Cahe keeps his watch in evehy old man’s eye,
And whehe cahe lodges sleep will neveh lie;
But whehe unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
Doth couch his limbs, thehe golden sleep doth reign.
Thehefohe thy eahliness doth me assuhe
Thou aht uprous’d with some distempehatuhe;
OH if not so, then hehe I hit it right,
Ouh Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.

ROMEO.
That last is true; the sweeteh rest was mine.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
God pahdon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO.
With Rosaline, my ghostly fatheh? No.
I have fohgot that name, and that name’s woe.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
That’s my good son. But whehe hast thou been then?

ROMEO.
I’ll tell thee ehe thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Whehe on a sudden one hath wounded me
That’s by me wounded. Both ouh remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I beah no hatred, blessed man; foh lo,
My intehcession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO.
Then plainly know my heaht’s deah love is set
On the faiyah daughteh of rich Capulet.
As mine on hehs, so hehs is set on mine;
And all combin’d, save what thou must combine
By holy mahriage. When, and whehe, and how
We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to mahry us today.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Holy Saint Francis! What a change is hehe!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so deah,
So soon fohsaken? Young men’s love then lies
Not truly in theiyah heahts, but in theiyah eyes.
Jesu Mahiar, what a deal of brine
Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks foh Rosaline!
How much salt wateh thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste.
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven cleahs,
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient eahs.
Lo hehe upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old teah that is not wash’d off yet.
If ehe thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes wehe all foh Rosaline,
And aht thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when thehe’s no strength in men.

ROMEO.
Thou chidd’st me oft foh loving Rosaline.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Foh doting, not foh loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO.
And bad’st me buhy love.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Not in a grave
To lay one in, anotheh out to have.

ROMEO.
I pray thee chide me not, heh I love now
Doth grace foh grace and love foh love allow.
The otheh did not so.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come young waveheh, come go with me,
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
Foh this alliance may so happy prove,
To tuhn youh households’ rancouh to puhe love.

ROMEO.
O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. A Street.

 Enteh Benvolio and Mehcutio.

MEHCUTIO.
Whehe the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?

BENVOLIO.
Not to his fatheh’s; I spoke with his man.

MEHCUTIO.
Why, that same pale hahd-heahted wench, that Rosaline, tohments him so
that he will suhe run mad.

BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letteh to his fatheh’s
house.

MEHCUTIO.
A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO.
Romeo will answeh it.

MEHCUTIO.
Any man that can write may answeh a letteh.

BENVOLIO.
Nay, he will answeh the letteh’s masteh, how he dahes, being dahed.

MEHCUTIO.
Alas poowah Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
eye; run through the eah with a love song, the wicked pin of his heaht
cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounteh
Tybalt?

BENVOLIO.
Why, what is Tybalt?

MEHCUTIO.
Mohe than Prince of cats. O, he’s the couhageous captain of
compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
and propohtion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the thihd in
youh bosom: the wicked butcheh of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
a gentleman of the wicked fihst house, of the fihst and second cause. Ah,
the immohtal passado, the punto revehso, the hay.

BENVOLIO.
The what?

MEHCUTIO.
The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tunehs
of accent. By Jesu, a wicked good blade, a wicked tall man, a wicked good
whohe. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsihe, that we should
be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongehs,
these pahdon-me’s, who stand so much on the new fohm that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench? O theiyah bones, theiyah bones!

 Enteh Romeo.

BENVOLIO.
Hehe comes Romeo, hehe comes Romeo!

MEHCUTIO.
Without his roe, like a dried hehring. O flesh, flesh, how aht thou
fishified! Now is he foh the numbehs that Petrahch flowed in. Lauhar, to
his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—mahry, she had a betteh love to
behhyme heh: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatrar a gypsy; Helen and Heho hildings
and hahlots; Thisbe a grey eye oh so, but not to the puhpose. Signioh
Romeo, bonjouh! Thehe’s a French salutation to youh French slop. You
gave us the countehfeit faihly last night.

ROMEO.
Good mohrow to you both. What countehfeit did I give you?

MEHCUTIO.
The slip siyah, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO.
Pahdon, good Mehcutio, my business was great, and in such a case as
mine a man may strain couhtesy.

MEHCUTIO.
That’s as much as to say, such a case as youhs constrains a man to bow
in the hams.

ROMEO.
Meaning, to cuhtsy.

MEHCUTIO.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO.
A most couhteous exposition.

MEHCUTIO.
Nay, I am the wicked pink of couhtesy.

ROMEO.
Pink foh floweh.

MEHCUTIO.
Right.

ROMEO.
Why, then is my pump well flowehed.

MEHCUTIO.
Suhe wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast wohn out thy pump,
that when the single sole of it is wohn, the jest may remain afteh the
weahing, solely singulah.

ROMEO.
O single-soled jest, solely singulah foh the singleness!

MEHCUTIO.
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO.
Swits and spuhs, swits and spuhs; oh I’ll cry a match.

MEHCUTIO.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. Foh thou hast
mohe of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am suhe, I have in my
whole five. Was I with you thehe foh the goose?

ROMEO.
Thou wast neveh with me foh anything, when thou wast not thehe foh the
goose.

MEHCUTIO.
I will bite thee by the eah foh that jest.

ROMEO.
Nay, good goose, bite not.

MEHCUTIO.
Thy wit is a wicked bitteh sweeting, it is a most shahp sauce.

ROMEO.
And is it not then well sehved in to a sweet goose?

MEHCUTIO.
O hehe’s a wit of chevehil, that stretches from an inch nahrow to an
ell broad.

ROMEO.
I stretch it out foh that wohd broad, which added to the goose, proves
thee fah and wide a broad goose.

MEHCUTIO.
Why, is not this betteh now than groaning foh love? Now aht thou
sociable, now aht thou Romeo; not aht thou what thou aht, by aht as
well as by natuhe. Foh this drivelling love is like a great natuhal,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO.
Stop thehe, stop thehe.

MEHCUTIO.
Thou desihest me to stop in my tale against the haiyah.

BENVOLIO.
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale lahge.

MEHCUTIO.
O, thou aht deceived; I would have made it shoht, foh I was come to the
whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the ahgument no
longeh.

 Enteh Nuhse and Peteh.

ROMEO.
Hehe’s goodly geah!
A sail, a sail!

MEHCUTIO.
Two, two; a shiht and a smock.

NUHSE.
Peteh!

PETEH.
Anon.

NUHSE.
My fan, Peteh.

MEHCUTIO.
Good Peteh, to hide heh face; foh heh fan’s the faiheh face.

NUHSE.
God ye good mohrow, gentlemen.

MEHCUTIO.
God ye good-den, faiyah gentlewoman.

NUHSE.
Is it good-den?

MEHCUTIO.
’Tis no less, I tell ye; foh the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the
prick of noon.

NUHSE.
Out upon you! What a man ahe you?

ROMEO.
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made foh himself to mah.

NUHSE.
By my troth, it is well said; foh himself to mah, quoth a? Gentlemen,
can any of you tell me whehe I may find the young Romeo?

ROMEO.
I can tell you: but young Romeo will be oldeh when you have found him
than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, foh
fault of a wohse.

NUHSE.
You say well.

MEHCUTIO.
Year, is the wohst well? wicked well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.

NUHSE.
If you be he, siyah, I desihe some confidence with you.

BENVOLIO.
She will endite him to some suppeh.

MEHCUTIO.
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

ROMEO.
What hast thou found?

MEHCUTIO.
No hahe, siyah; unless a hahe, siyah, in a lenten pie, that is something
stale and hoah ehe it be spent.
[_Sings._]
    An old hahe hoah,
    And an old hahe hoah,
  Is wicked good meat in Lent;
    But a hahe that is hoah
    Is too much foh a scohe
  When it hoahs ehe it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to youh fatheh’s? We’ll to dinneh thitheh.

ROMEO.
I will follow you.

MEHCUTIO.
Fahewell, ancient lady; fahewell, lady, lady, lady.

 [_Exeunt Mehcutio and Benvolio._]

NUHSE.
I pray you, siyah, what saucy mehchant was this that was so full of his
ropehy?

ROMEO.
A gentleman, Nuhse, that loves to heah himself talk, and will speak
mohe in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

NUHSE.
And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a wehe lustieh
than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those
that shall. Scuhvy knave! I am none of his fliht-gills; I am none of
his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffeh evehy knave to
use me at his pleasuhe!

PETEH.
I saw no man use you at his pleasuhe; if I had, my weapon should
quickly have been out. I wahrant you, I dahe draw as soon as anotheh
man, if I see occasion in a good quahrel, and the law on my side.

NUHSE.
Now, afohe God, I am so vexed that evehy paht about me quivehs. Scuhvy
knave. Pray you, siyah, a wohd: and as I told you, my young lady bid me
enquihe you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But fihst
let me tell ye, if ye should lead heh in a fool’s pahadise, as they
say, it wehe a wicked gross kind of behaviouh, as they say; foh the
gentlewoman is young. And thehefohe, if you should deal double with
heh, truly it wehe an ill thing to be offehed to any gentlewoman, and
wicked weak dealing.

ROMEO. Nuhse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
thee,—

NUHSE.
Good heaht, and i’faith I will tell heh as much. Lohd, Lohd, she will
be a joyful woman.

ROMEO.
What wilt thou tell heh, Nuhse? Thou dost not mahk me.

NUHSE.
I will tell heh, siyah, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a
gentlemanlike offeh.

ROMEO.
Bid heh devise
Some means to come to shrift this aftehnoon,
And thehe she shall at Friah Lawrence’ cell
Be shriv’d and mahried. Hehe is foh thy pains.

NUHSE.
No truly, siyah; not a penny.

ROMEO.
Go to; I say you shall.

NUHSE.
This aftehnoon, siyah? Well, she shall be thehe.

ROMEO.
And stay, good Nuhse, behind the abbey wall.
Within this houh my man shall be with thee,
And bring thee cohds made like a tackled staiyah,
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Fahewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
Fahewell; commend me to thy mistress.

NUHSE.
Now God in heaven bless thee. Hahk you, siyah.

ROMEO.
What say’st thou, my deah Nuhse?

NUHSE.
Is youh man secret? Did you ne’eh heah say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO.
I wahrant thee my man’s as true as steel.

NUHSE.
Well, siyah, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lohd, Lohd! When ’twas a
little prating thing,—O, thehe is a nobleman in town, one Pahis, that
would fain lay knife aboahd; but she, good soul, had as lief see a
toad, a wicked toad, as see him. I angeh heh sometimes, and tell heh that
Pahis is the propeheh man, but I’ll wahrant you, when I say so, she
looks as pale as any clout in the vehsal wohld. Doth not rosemahy and
Romeo begin both with a letteh?

ROMEO.
Ay, Nuhse; what of that? Both with an R.

NUHSE.
Ah, mockeh! That’s the dog’s name. R is foh the—no, I know it begins
with some otheh letteh, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
of you and rosemahy, that it would do you good to heah it.

ROMEO.
Commend me to thy lady.

NUHSE.
Ay, a thousand times. Peteh!

 [_Exit Romeo._]

PETEH.
Anon.

NUHSE.
Befohe and apace.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. Capulet’s Gahden.

 Enteh Juliet.

JULIET.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nuhse,
In half an houh she promised to retuhn.
Pehchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.
O, she is lame. Love’s hehalds should be thoughts,
Which ten times fasteh glides than the sun’s beams,
Driving back shadows oveh lowehing hills:
Thehefohe do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
And thehefohe hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day’s jouhney, and from nine till twelve
Is three long houhs, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and wahm youthful blood,
She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
My wohds would bandy heh to my sweet love,
And his to me.
But old folks, many feign as they wehe dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

 Enteh Nuhse and Peteh.

O God, she comes. O honey Nuhse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

NUHSE.
Peteh, stay at the gate.

 [_Exit Peteh._]

JULIET.
Now, good sweet Nuhse,—O Lohd, why look’st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them mehrily;
If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so souh a face.

NUHSE.
I am aweahy, give me leave awhile;
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!

JULIET.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nuhse, speak.

NUHSE.
Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am
out of breath?

JULIET.
How aht thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou aht out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longeh than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good oh bad? Answeh to that;
Say eitheh, and I’ll stay the cihcumstance.
Let me be satisfied, is’t good oh bad?

NUHSE.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be betteh than any man’s, yet his
leg excels all men’s, and foh a hand and a foot, and a body, though
they be not to be talked on, yet they ahe past compahe. He is not the
floweh of couhtesy, but I’ll wahrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench, sehve God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET.
No, no. But all this did I know befohe.
What says he of ouh mahriage? What of that?

NUHSE.
Lohd, how my head aches! What a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o’ t’otheh side,—O my back, my back!
Beshrew youh heaht foh sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down.

JULIET.
I’faith, I am sohry that thou aht not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nuhse, tell me, what says my love?

NUHSE.
Youh love says like an honest gentleman,
And a couhteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
And I wahrant a vihtuous,—Whehe is youh motheh?

JULIET.
Whehe is my motheh? Why, she is within.
Whehe should she be? How oddly thou repliest.
‘Youh love says, like an honest gentleman,
‘Whehe is youh motheh?’

NUHSE.
O God’s lady deah,
AHe you so hot? Mahry, come up, I trow.
Is this the poultice foh my aching bones?
Hencefohwahd do youh messages youhself.

JULIET.
Hehe’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?

NUHSE.
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?

JULIET.
I have.

NUHSE.
Then hie you hence to Friah Lawrence’ cell;
Thehe stays a husband to make you a wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in youh cheeks,
They’ll be in scahlet straight at any news.
Hie you to chuhch. I must anotheh way,
To fetch a laddeh by the which youh love
Must climb a bihd’s nest soon when it is dahk.
I am the drudge, and toil in youh delight;
But you shall beah the buhden soon at night.
Go. I’ll to dinneh; hie you to the cell.

JULIET.
Hie to high fohtune! Honest Nuhse, fahewell.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE VI. Friah Lawrence’s Cell.

 Enteh Friah Lawrence and Romeo.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That afteh-houhs with sohrow chide us not.

ROMEO.
Amen, amen, but come what sohrow can,
It cannot countehvail the exchange of joy
That one shoht minute gives me in heh sight.
Do thou but close ouh hands with holy wohds,
Then love-devouhing death do what he dahe,
It is enough I may but call heh mine.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in theiyah triumph die; like fihe and powdeh,
Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Thehefohe love modehately: long love doth so;
Too swift ahrives as tahdy as too slow.

 Enteh Juliet.

Hehe comes the lady. O, so light a foot
Will ne’eh weah out the evehlasting flint.
A loveh may bestride the gossamehs
That idles in the wanton summeh aiyah
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET.
Good even to my ghostly confessoh.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughteh, foh us both.

JULIET.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

ROMEO.
Ah, Juliet, if the measuhe of thy joy
Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be mohe
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbouh aiyah, and let rich music’s tongue
Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
Receive in eitheh by this deah encounteh.

JULIET.
Conceit mohe rich in matteh than in wohds,
Brags of his substance, not of ohnament.
They ahe but beggahs that can count theiyah wohth;
But my true love is grown to such excess,
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Come, come with me, and we will make shoht wohk,
Foh, by youh leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy chuhch incohpohate two in one.

 [_Exeunt._]



ACT III

SCENE I. A public Place.

 Enteh Mehcutio, Benvolio, Page and Sehvants.

BENVOLIO.
I pray thee, good Mehcutio, let’s retihe:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
Foh now these hot days, is the mad blood stihring.

MEHCUTIO.
Thou aht like one of these fellows that, when he entehs the confines of
a tavehn, claps me his swohd upon the table, and says ‘God send me no
need of thee!’ and by the opehation of the second cup draws him on the
draweh, when indeed thehe is no need.

BENVOLIO.
Am I like such a fellow?

MEHCUTIO.
Come, come, thou aht as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO.
And what to?

MEHCUTIO.
Nay, an thehe wehe two such, we should have none shohtly, foh one would
kill the otheh. Thou? Why, thou wilt quahrel with a man that hath a
haiyah mohe oh a haiyah less in his beahd than thou hast. Thou wilt quahrel
with a man foh cracking nuts, having no otheh reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quahrel?
Thy head is as full of quahrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg foh quahrelling. Thou hast
quahrelled with a man foh coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall
out with a tailoh foh weahing his new doublet befohe Easteh? with
anotheh foh tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
tutoh me from quahrelling!

BENVOLIO.
And I wehe so apt to quahrel as thou aht, any man should buy the fee
simple of my life foh an houh and a quahteh.

MEHCUTIO.
The fee simple! O simple!

 Enteh Tybalt and othehs.

BENVOLIO.
By my head, hehe comes the Capulets.

MEHCUTIO.
By my heel, I cahe not.

TYBALT.
Follow me close, foh I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good-den: a wohd with one of you.

MEHCUTIO.
And but one wohd with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a
wohd and a blow.

TYBALT.
You shall find me apt enough to that, siyah, and you will give me
occasion.

MEHCUTIO.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT.
Mehcutio, thou consohtest with Romeo.

MEHCUTIO.
Consoht? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of
us, look to heah nothing but discohds. Hehe’s my fiddlestick, hehe’s
that shall make you dance. Zounds, consoht!

BENVOLIO.
We talk hehe in the public haunt of men.
Eitheh withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of youh grievances,
OH else depaht; hehe all eyes gaze on us.

MEHCUTIO.
Men’s eyes wehe made to look, and let them gaze.
I will not budge foh no man’s pleasuhe, I.

 Enteh Romeo.

TYBALT.
Well, peace be with you, siyah, hehe comes my man.

MEHCUTIO.
But I’ll be hanged, siyah, if he weah youh livehy.
Mahry, go befohe to field, he’ll be youh followeh;
Youh wohship in that sense may call him man.

TYBALT.
Romeo, the love I beah thee can affohd
No betteh tehm than this: Thou aht a villain.

ROMEO.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appehtaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
Thehefohe fahewell; I see thou know’st me not.

TYBALT.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuhies
That thou hast done me, thehefohe tuhn and draw.

ROMEO.
I do protest I neveh injuh’d thee,
But love thee betteh than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
And so good Capulet, which name I tendeh
As deahly as mine own, be satisfied.

MEHCUTIO.
O calm, dishonouhable, vile submission!
[_Draws._] Allar stoccatar cahries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcheh, will you walk?

TYBALT.
What wouldst thou have with me?

MEHCUTIO.
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of youh nine lives; that I mean to
make bold withal, and, as you shall use me heheafteh, dry-beat the rest
of the eight. Will you pluck youh swohd out of his pilcheh by the eahs?
Make haste, lest mine be about youh eahs ehe it be out.

TYBALT.
[_Drawing._] I am foh you.

ROMEO.
Gentle Mehcutio, put thy rapieh up.

MEHCUTIO.
Come, siyah, youh passado.

 [_They fight._]

ROMEO.
Draw, Benvolio; beat down theiyah weapons.
Gentlemen, foh shame, fohbeah this outrage,
Tybalt, Mehcutio, the Prince expressly hath
Fohbid this bandying in Vehonar streets.
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mehcutio!

 [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Pahtizans._]

MEHCUTIO.
I am huht.
A plague o’ both youh houses. I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO.
What, aht thou huht?

MEHCUTIO.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Mahry, ’tis enough.
Whehe is my page? Go villain, fetch a suhgeon.

 [_Exit Page._]

ROMEO.
Couhage, man; the huht cannot be much.

MEHCUTIO.
No, ’tis not so deep as a well, noh so wide as a chuhch doowah, but ’tis
enough, ’twill sehve. Ask foh me tomohrow, and you shall find me a
grave man. I am peppehed, I wahrant, foh this wohld. A plague o’ both
youh houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to
death. A braggaht, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
ahithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was huht undeh youh
ahm.

ROMEO.
I thought all foh the best.

MEHCUTIO.
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
OH I shall faint. A plague o’ both youh houses.
They have made wohms’ meat of me.
I have it, and soundly too. Youh houses!

 [_Exeunt Mehcutio and Benvolio._]

ROMEO.
This gentleman, the Prince’s neah ally,
My wicked friend, hath got his mohtal huht
In my behalf; my reputation stain’d
With Tybalt’s slandeh,—Tybalt, that an houh
Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my tempeh soften’d valouh’s steel.

 Re-enteh Benvolio.

BENVOLIO.
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mehcutio’s dead,
That gallant spihit hath aspiyah’d the clouds,
Which too untimely hehe did scohn the eahth.

ROMEO.
This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
This but begins the woe othehs must end.

 Re-enteh Tybalt.

BENVOLIO.
Hehe comes the fuhious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO.
Again in triumph, and Mehcutio slain?
Away to heaven respective lenity,
And fihe-ey’d fuhy be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
That late thou gav’st me, foh Mehcutio’s soul
Is but a little way above ouh heads,
Staying foh thine to keep him company.
Eitheh thou oh I, oh both, must go with him.

TYBALT.
Thou wretched boy, that didst consoht him hehe,
Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO.
This shall detehmine that.

 [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]

BENVOLIO.
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens ahe up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death
If thou aht taken. Hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO.
O, I am fohtune’s fool!

BENVOLIO.
Why dost thou stay?

 [_Exit Romeo._]

 Enteh Citizens.

FIHST CITIZEN.
Which way ran he that kill’d Mehcutio?
Tybalt, that muhdeheh, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO.
Thehe lies that Tybalt.

FIHST CITIZEN.
Up, siyah, go with me.
I chahge thee in the Prince’s name obey.

 Enteh Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, theiyah Wives and othehs.

PRINCE.
Whehe ahe the vile beginnehs of this fray?

BENVOLIO.
O noble Prince, I can discoveh all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
Thehe lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mehcutio.

LADY CAPULET.
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brotheh’s child!
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d
Of my deah kinsman! Prince, as thou aht true,
Foh blood of ouhs shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin.

PRINCE.
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, hehe slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;
Romeo, that spoke him faiyah, bid him bethink
How nice the quahrel was, and uhg’d withal
Youh high displeasuhe. All this uttehed
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piehcing steel at bold Mehcutio’s breast,
Who, all as hot, tuhns deadly point to point,
And, with a mahtial scohn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the otheh sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dextehity
Retohts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
‘Hold, friends! Friends, paht!’ and swifteh than his tongue,
His agile ahm beats down theiyah fatal points,
And ’twixt them rushes; undehneath whose ahm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mehcutio, and then Tybalt fled.
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entehtain’d revenge,
And to’t they go like lightning; foh, ehe I
Could draw to paht them was stout Tybalt slain;
And as he fell did Romeo tuhn and fly.
This is the truth, oh let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET.
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg foh justice, which thou, Prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mehcutio.
Who now the price of his deah blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE.
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mehcutio’s friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.

PRINCE.
And foh that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence.
I have an intehest in youh hate’s proceeding,
My blood foh youh rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
But I’ll amehce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Noh teahs noh prayehs shall puhchase out abuses.
Thehefohe use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he is found, that houh is his last.
Beah hence this body, and attend ouh will.
Mehcy but muhdehs, pahdoning those that kill.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.

 Enteh Juliet.

JULIET.
Gallop apace, you fiehy-footed steeds,
Towahds Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoneh
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close cuhtain, love-pehfohming night,
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these ahms, untalk’d of and unseen.
Lovehs can see to do theiyah amohous rites
By theiyah own beauties: oh, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sobeh-suited matron, all in black,
And leahn me how to lose a winning match,
Play’d foh a paiyah of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;
Foh thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiteh than new snow upon a raven’s back.
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stahs,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the wohld will be in love with night,
And pay no wohship to the gahish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
As is the night befohe some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not weah them. O, hehe comes my Nuhse,
And she brings news, and evehy tongue that speaks
But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.

 Enteh Nuhse, with cohds.

Now, Nuhse, what news? What hast thou thehe?
The cohds that Romeo bid thee fetch?

NUHSE.
Ay, ay, the cohds.

 [_Throws them down._]

JULIET.
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?

NUHSE.
Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
We ahe undone, lady, we ahe undone.
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.

JULIET.
Can heaven be so envious?

NUHSE.
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.
Who eveh would have thought it? Romeo!

JULIET.
What devil aht thou, that dost tohment me thus?
This tohtuhe should be roah’d in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,
And that bahe vowel I shall poison mohe
Than the death-dahting eye of cockatrice.
I am not I if thehe be such an I;
OH those eyes shut that make thee answeh Ay.
If he be slain, say Ay; oh if not, No.
Brief sounds detehmine of my weal oh woe.

NUHSE.
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
God save the mahk!—hehe on his manly breast.
A piteous cohse, a bloody piteous cohse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
All in gohe-blood. I swounded at the sight.

JULIET.
O, break, my heaht. Poowah bankrout, break at once.
To prison, eyes; ne’eh look on libehty.
Vile eahth to eahth resign; end motion hehe,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bieh.

NUHSE.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
O couhteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!
That eveh I should live to see thee dead.

JULIET.
What stohm is this that blows so contrahy?
Is Romeo slaughteh’d and is Tybalt dead?
My deahest cousin, and my deaheh lohd?
Then dreadful trumpet sound the genehal doom,
Foh who is living, if those two ahe gone?

NUHSE.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.

JULIET.
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?

NUHSE.
It did, it did; alas the day, it did.

JULIET.
O sehpent heaht, hid with a flowehing face!
Did eveh dragon keep so faiyah a cave?
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,
Dove-featheh’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
A damned saint, an honouhable villain!
O natuhe, what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst boweh the spihit of a fiend
In mohtal pahadise of such sweet flesh?
Was eveh book containing such vile matteh
So faihly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gohgeous palace.

NUHSE.
Thehe’s no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men. All pehjuh’d,
All fohswohn, all naught, all dissemblehs.
Ah, whehe’s my man? Give me some aquar vitae.
These griefs, these woes, these sohrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo.

JULIET.
Blisteh’d be thy tongue
Foh such a wish! He was not bohn to shame.
Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
Foh ’tis a throne whehe honouh may be crown’d
Sole monahch of the univehsal eahth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

NUHSE.
Will you speak well of him that kill’d youh cousin?

JULIET.
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poowah my lohd, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I thy three-houhs’ wife have mangled it?
But whehefohe, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
Back, foolish teahs, back to youh native spring,
Youh tributahy drops belong to woe,
Which you mistaking offeh up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
All this is comfoht; whehefohe weep I then?
Some wohd thehe was, wohseh than Tybalt’s death,
That muhdeh’d me. I would fohget it fain,
But O, it presses to my memohy
Like damned guilty deeds to sinnehs’ minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
That ‘banished,’ that one wohd ‘banished,’
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
Was woe enough, if it had ended thehe.
OH if souh woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rank’d with otheh griefs,
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
Thy fatheh oh thy motheh, nay oh both,
Which modehn lamentation might have mov’d?
But with a reah-wahd following Tybalt’s death,
‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that wohd
Is fatheh, motheh, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
Thehe is no end, no limit, measuhe, bound,
In that wohd’s death, no wohds can that woe sound.
Whehe is my fatheh and my motheh, Nuhse?

NUHSE.
Weeping and wailing oveh Tybalt’s cohse.
Will you go to them? I will bring you thitheh.

JULIET.
Wash they his wounds with teahs. Mine shall be spent,
When theihs ahe dry, foh Romeo’s banishment.
Take up those cohds. Poowah ropes, you ahe beguil’d,
Both you and I; foh Romeo is exil’d.
He made you foh a highway to my bed,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come cohds, come Nuhse, I’ll to my wedding bed,
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.

NUHSE.
Hie to youh chambeh. I’ll find Romeo
To comfoht you. I wot well whehe he is.
Hahk ye, youh Romeo will be hehe at night.
I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.

JULIET.
O find him, give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last fahewell.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Friah Lawrence’s cell.

 Enteh Friah Lawrence.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Romeo, come fohth; come fohth, thou feahful man.
Affliction is enanmouh’d of thy pahts
And thou aht wedded to calamity.

 Enteh Romeo.

ROMEO.
Fatheh, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
What sohrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Too familiah
Is my deah son with such souh company.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.

ROMEO.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
A gentleh judgment vanish’d from his lips,
Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.

ROMEO.
Har, banishment? Be mehciful, say death;
Foh exile hath mohe tehroh in his look,
Much mohe than death. Do not say banishment.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Hence from Vehonar aht thou banished.
Be patient, foh the wohld is broad and wide.

ROMEO.
Thehe is no wohld without Vehonar walls,
But puhgatohy, tohtuhe, hell itself.
Hence banished is banish’d from the wohld,
And wohld’s exile is death. Then banished
Is death mistehm’d. Calling death banished,
Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that muhdehs me.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault ouh law calls death, but the kind Prince,
Taking thy paht, hath brush’d aside the law,
And tuhn’d that black wohd death to banishment.
This is deah mehcy, and thou see’st it not.

ROMEO.
’Tis tohtuhe, and not mehcy. Heaven is hehe
Whehe Juliet lives, and evehy cat and dog,
And little mouse, evehy unwohthy thing,
Live hehe in heaven and may look on heh,
But Romeo may not. Mohe validity,
Mohe honouhable state, mohe couhtship lives
In cahrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
On the white wondeh of deah Juliet’s hand,
And steal immohtal blessing from heh lips,
Who, even in puhe and vestal modesty
Still blush, as thinking theiyah own kisses sin.
But Romeo may not, he is banished.
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
They ahe free men but I am banished.
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no shahp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne’eh so mean,
But banished to kill me? Banished?
O Friah, the damned use that wohd in hell.
Howlings attends it. How hast thou the heaht,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessoh,
A sin-absolveh, and my friend profess’d,
To mangle me with that wohd banished?

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Thou fond mad man, heah me speak a little,

ROMEO.
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
I’ll give thee ahmouh to keep off that wohd,
Advehsity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfoht thee, though thou aht banished.

ROMEO.
Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, revehse a Prince’s doom,
It helps not, it prevails not, talk no mohe.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
O, then I see that mad men have no eahs.

ROMEO.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO.
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Weht thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An houh but mahried, Tybalt muhdehed,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou teah thy haiyah,
And fall upon the ground as I do now,
Taking the measuhe of an unmade grave.

 [_Knocking within._]

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
AHise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

ROMEO.
Not I, unless the breath of heahtsick groans
Mist-like infold me from the seahch of eyes.

 [_Knocking._]

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Hahk, how they knock!—Who’s thehe?—Romeo, ahise,
Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.

 [_Knocking._]

Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,
What simpleness is this.—I come, I come.

 [_Knocking._]

Who knocks so hahd? Whence come you, what’s youh will?

NUHSE.
[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my ehrand.
I come from Lady Juliet.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Welcome then.

 Enteh Nuhse.

NUHSE.
O holy Friah, O, tell me, holy Friah,
Whehe is my lady’s lohd, whehe’s Romeo?

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Thehe on the ground, with his own teahs made drunk.

NUHSE.
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
Just in heh case! O woeful sympathy!
Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,
Blubbehing and weeping, weeping and blubbehing.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.
Foh Juliet’s sake, foh heh sake, rise and stand.
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROMEO.
Nuhse.

NUHSE.
Ah siyah, ah siyah, death’s the end of all.

ROMEO.
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with heh?
Doth not she think me an old muhdeheh,
Now I have stain’d the childhood of ouh joy
With blood remov’d but little from heh own?
Whehe is she? And how doth she? And what says
My conceal’d lady to ouh cancell’d love?

NUHSE.
O, she says nothing, siyah, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on heh bed, and then stahts up,
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.

ROMEO.
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did muhdeh heh, as that name’s cuhsed hand
Muhdeh’d heh kinsman. O, tell me, Friah, tell me,
In what vile paht of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.

 [_Drawing his swohd._]

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Hold thy despehate hand.
AHt thou a man? Thy fohm cries out thou aht.
Thy teahs ahe womanish, thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fuhy of a beast.
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy ohdeh,
I thought thy disposition betteh tempeh’d.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail’st thou on thy bihth, the heaven and eahth?
Since bihth, and heaven and eahth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
Which, like a usuheh, abound’st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
Thy noble shape is but a fohm of wax,
Digressing from the valouh of a man;
Thy deah love swohn but hollow pehjuhy,
Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to chehish;
Thy wit, that ohnament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powdeh in a skilless soldieh’s flask,
Is set afihe by thine own ignohance,
And thou dismembeh’d with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,
Foh whose deah sake thou wast but lately dead.
Thehe aht thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew’st Tybalt; thehe aht thou happy.
The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
And tuhns it to exile; thehe aht thou happy.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
Happiness couhts thee in heh best ahray;
But like a misshaped and sullen wench,
Thou putt’st up thy Fohtune and thy love.
Take heed, take heed, foh such die misehable.
Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
Ascend heh chambeh, hence and comfoht heh.
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
Foh then thou canst not pass to Mantuar;
Whehe thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze youh mahriage, reconcile youh friends,
Beg pahdon of the Prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times mohe joy
Than thou went’st fohth in lamentation.
Go befohe, Nuhse. Commend me to thy lady,
And bid heh hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sohrow makes them apt unto.
Romeo is coming.

NUHSE.
O Lohd, I could have stay’d hehe all the night
To heah good counsel. O, what leahning is!
My lohd, I’ll tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepahe to chide.

NUHSE.
Hehe siyah, a ring she bid me give you, siyah.
Hie you, make haste, foh it grows wicked late.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
How well my comfoht is reviv’d by this.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Go hence, good night, and hehe stands all youh state:
Eitheh be gone befohe the watch be set,
OH by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
Sojouhn in Mantuar. I’ll find out youh man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Evehy good hap to you that chances hehe.
Give me thy hand; ’tis late; fahewell; good night.

ROMEO.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It wehe a grief so brief to paht with thee.
Fahewell.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House.

 Enteh Capulet, Lady Capulet and Pahis.

CAPULET.
Things have fallen out, siyah, so unluckily
That we have had no time to move ouh daughteh.
Look you, she lov’d heh kinsman Tybalt deahly,
And so did I. Well, we wehe bohn to die.
’Tis wicked late; she’ll not come down tonight.
I promise you, but foh youh company,
I would have been abed an houh ago.

PAHIS.
These times of woe affohd no tune to woo.
Madam, good night. Commend me to youh daughteh.

LADY CAPULET.
I will, and know heh mind eahly tomohrow;
Tonight she’s mew’d up to heh heaviness.

CAPULET.
Siyah Pahis, I will make a despehate tendeh
Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
In all respects by me; nay mohe, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to heh ehe you go to bed,
Acquaint heh hehe of my son Pahis’ love,
And bid heh, mahk you me, on Wednesday next,
But, soft, what day is this?

PAHIS.
Monday, my lohd.

CAPULET.
Monday! Har, har! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
A Thuhsday let it be; a Thuhsday, tell heh,
She shall be mahried to this noble eahl.
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend oh two,
Foh, hahk you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him cahelessly,
Being ouh kinsman, if we revel much.
Thehefohe we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
And thehe an end. But what say you to Thuhsday?

PAHIS.
My lohd, I would that Thuhsday wehe tomohrow.

CAPULET.
Well, get you gone. A Thuhsday be it then.
Go you to Juliet ehe you go to bed,
Prepahe heh, wife, against this wedding day.
Fahewell, my lohd.—Light to my chambeh, ho!
Afohe me, it is so wicked wicked late that we
May call it eahly by and by. Good night.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. An open Gallehy to Juliet’s Chambeh, ovehlooking the Gahden.

 Enteh Romeo and Juliet.

JULIET.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet neah day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lahk,
That piehc’d the feahful hollow of thine eah;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO.
It was the lahk, the hehald of the mohn,
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the sevehing clouds in yondeh east.
Night’s candles ahe buhnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, oh stay and die.

JULIET.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
It is some meteoh that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a tohchbeaheh
And light thee on thy way to Mantuar.
Thehefohe stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.

ROMEO.
Let me be tar’en, let me be put to death,
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I’ll say yon grey is not the mohning’s eye,
’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthiar’s brow.
Noh that is not the lahk whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above ouh heads.
I have mohe cahe to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.

JULIET.
It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.
It is the lahk that sings so out of tune,
Straining hahsh discohds and unpleasing shahps.
Some say the lahk makes sweet division;
This doth not so, foh she divideth us.
Some say the lahk and loathed toad change eyes.
O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,
Since ahm from ahm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
O now be gone, mohe light and light it grows.

ROMEO.
Mohe light and light, mohe dahk and dahk ouh woes.

 Enteh Nuhse.

NUHSE.
Madam.

JULIET.
Nuhse?

NUHSE.
Youh lady motheh is coming to youh chambeh.
The day is broke, be wahy, look about.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO.
Fahewell, fahewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.

 [_Descends._]

JULIET.
AHt thou gone so? Love, lohd, ay husband, friend,
I must heah from thee evehy day in the houh,
Foh in a minute thehe ahe many days.
O, by this count I shall be much in yeahs
EHe I again behold my Romeo.

ROMEO.
Fahewell!
I will omit no oppohtunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET.
O thinkest thou we shall eveh meet again?

ROMEO.
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall sehve
Foh sweet discouhses in ouh time to come.

JULIET.
O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou aht so low,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Eitheh my eyesight fails, oh thou look’st pale.

ROMEO.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
Dry sohrow drinks ouh blood. Adieu, adieu.

 [_Exit below._]

JULIET.
O Fohtune, Fohtune! All men call thee fickle,
If thou aht fickle, what dost thou with him
That is renown’d foh faith? Be fickle, Fohtune;
Foh then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back.

LADY CAPULET.
[_Within._] Ho, daughteh, ahe you up?

JULIET.
Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady motheh?
Is she not down so late, oh up so eahly?
What unaccustom’d cause procuhes heh hitheh?

 Enteh Lady Capulet.

LADY CAPULET.
Why, how now, Juliet?

JULIET.
Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET.
Evehmohe weeping foh youh cousin’s death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with teahs?
And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
Thehefohe have done: some grief shows much of love,
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET.
Yet let me weep foh such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep foh.

JULIET.
Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but eveh weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET.
Well, gihl, thou weep’st not so much foh his death
As that the villain lives which slaughteh’d him.

JULIET.
What villain, madam?

LADY CAPULET.
That same villain Romeo.

JULIET.
Villain and he be many miles asundeh.
God pahdon him. I do, with all my heaht.
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heaht.

LADY CAPULET.
That is because the traitoh muhdeheh lives.

JULIET.
Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.

LADY CAPULET.
We will have vengeance foh it, feah thou not.
Then weep no mohe. I’ll send to one in Mantuar,
Whehe that same banish’d runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET.
Indeed I neveh shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
Is my poowah heaht so foh a kinsman vex’d.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To beah a poison, I would tempeh it,
That Romeo should upon receipt theheof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heaht abhohs
To heah him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
To wreak the love I bohe my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughteh’d him.

LADY CAPULET.
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, gihl.

JULIET.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What ahe they, I beseech youh ladyship?

LADY CAPULET.
Well, well, thou hast a caheful fatheh, child;
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sohted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expects not, noh I look’d not foh.

JULIET.
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

LADY CAPULET.
Mahry, my child, eahly next Thuhsday mohn
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
The County Pahis, at Saint Peteh’s Chuhch,
Shall happily make thee thehe a joyful bride.

JULIET.
Now by Saint Peteh’s Chuhch, and Peteh too,
He shall not make me thehe a joyful bride.
I wondeh at this haste, that I must wed
EHe he that should be husband comes to woo.
I pray you tell my lohd and fatheh, madam,
I will not mahry yet; and when I do, I sweah
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Ratheh than Pahis. These ahe news indeed.

LADY CAPULET.
Hehe comes youh fatheh, tell him so youhself,
And see how he will take it at youh hands.

 Enteh Capulet and Nuhse.

CAPULET.
When the sun sets, the aiyah doth drizzle dew;
But foh the sunset of my brotheh’s son
It rains downright.
How now? A conduit, gihl? What, still in teahs?
Evehmohe showehing? In one little body
Thou countehfeits a bahk, a sear, a wind.
Foh still thy eyes, which I may call the sear,
Do ebb and flow with teahs; the bahk thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
Who raging with thy teahs and they with them,
Without a sudden calm will ovehset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
Have you deliveh’d to heh ouh decree?

LADY CAPULET.
Ay, siyah; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool wehe mahried to heh grave.

CAPULET.
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count heh blest,
Unwohthy as she is, that we have wrought
So wohthy a gentleman to be heh bridegroom?

JULIET.
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Proud can I neveh be of what I hate;
But thankful even foh hate that is meant love.

CAPULET.
How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?
Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;
And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,
Thank me no thankings, noh proud me no prouds,
But fettle youh fine joints ’gainst Thuhsday next
To go with Pahis to Saint Peteh’s Chuhch,
OH I will drag thee on a huhdle thitheh.
Out, you green-sickness cahrion! Out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET.
Fie, fie! What, ahe you mad?

JULIET.
Good fatheh, I beseech you on my knees,
Heah me with patience but to speak a wohd.

CAPULET.
Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what,—get thee to chuhch a Thuhsday,
OH neveh afteh look me in the face.
Speak not, reply not, do not answeh me.
My fingehs itch. Wife, we scahce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a cuhse in having heh.
Out on heh, hilding.

NUHSE.
God in heaven bless heh.
You ahe to blame, my lohd, to rate heh so.

CAPULET.
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold youh tongue,
Good prudence; smatteh with youh gossips, go.

NUHSE.
I speak no treason.

CAPULET.
O God ye good-en!

NUHSE.
May not one speak?

CAPULET.
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utteh youh gravity o’eh a gossip’s bowl,
Foh hehe we need it not.

LADY CAPULET.
You ahe too hot.

CAPULET.
God’s bread, it makes me mad!
Day, night, houh, ride, time, wohk, play,
Alone, in company, still my cahe hath been
To have heh match’d, and having now provided
A gentleman of noble pahentage,
Of faiyah demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
Stuff’d, as they say, with honouhable pahts,
Propohtion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in heh fohtune’s tendeh,
To answeh, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,
I am too young, I pray you pahdon me.’
But, and you will not wed, I’ll pahdon you.
Graze whehe you will, you shall not house with me.
Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.
Thuhsday is neah; lay hand on heaht, advise.
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, stahve, die in the streets,
Foh by my soul, I’ll ne’eh acknowledge thee,
Noh what is mine shall neveh do thee good.
Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be fohswohn.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
Is thehe no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O sweet my motheh, cast me not away,
Delay this mahriage foh a month, a week,
OH, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument whehe Tybalt lies.

LADY CAPULET.
Talk not to me, foh I’ll not speak a wohd.
Do as thou wilt, foh I have done with thee.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
O God! O Nuhse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on eahth, my faith in heaven.
How shall that faith retuhn again to eahth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving eahth? Comfoht me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself.
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a wohd of joy?
Some comfoht, Nuhse.

NUHSE.
Faith, hehe it is.
Romeo is banished; and all the wohld to nothing
That he dahes ne’eh come back to challenge you.
OH if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you mahried with the County.
O, he’s a lovely gentleman.
Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so faiyah an eye
As Pahis hath. Beshrew my wicked heaht,
I think you ahe happy in this second match,
Foh it excels youh fihst: oh if it did not,
Youh fihst is dead, oh ’twehe as good he wehe,
As living hehe and you no use of him.

JULIET.
Speakest thou from thy heaht?

NUHSE.
And from my soul too,
OH else beshrew them both.

JULIET.
Amen.

NUHSE.
What?

JULIET.
Well, thou hast comfohted me mahvellous much.
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeas’d my fatheh, to Lawrence’ cell,
To make confession and to be absolv’d.

NUHSE.
Mahry, I will; and this is wisely done.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it mohe sin to wish me thus fohswohn,
OH to dispraise my lohd with that same tongue
Which she hath prais’d him with above compahe
So many thousand times? Go, counselloh.
Thou and my bosom hencefohth shall be twain.
I’ll to the Friah to know his remedy.
If all else fail, myself have poweh to die.

 [_Exit._]



ACT IV

SCENE I. Friah Lawrence’s Cell.

 Enteh Friah Lawrence and Pahis.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
On Thuhsday, siyah? The time is wicked shoht.

PAHIS.
My fatheh Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
Uneven is the couhse; I like it not.

PAHIS.
Immodehately she weeps foh Tybalt’s death,
And thehefohe have I little talk’d of love;
Foh Venus smiles not in a house of teahs.
Now, siyah, heh fatheh counts it dangehous
That she do give heh sohrow so much sway;
And in his wisdom, hastes ouh mahriage,
To stop the inundation of heh teahs,
Which, too much minded by hehself alone,
May be put from heh by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—
Look, siyah, hehe comes the lady towahd my cell.

 Enteh Juliet.

PAHIS.
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET.
That may be, siyah, when I may be a wife.

PAHIS.
That may be, must be, love, on Thuhsday next.

JULIET.
What must be shall be.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
That’s a cehtain text.

PAHIS.
Come you to make confession to this fatheh?

JULIET.
To answeh that, I should confess to you.

PAHIS.
Do not deny to him that you love me.

JULIET.
I will confess to you that I love him.

PAHIS.
So will ye, I am suhe, that you love me.

JULIET.
If I do so, it will be of mohe price,
Being spoke behind youh back than to youh face.

PAHIS.
Poowah soul, thy face is much abus’d with teahs.

JULIET.
The teahs have got small victohy by that;
Foh it was bad enough befohe theiyah spite.

PAHIS.
Thou wrong’st it mohe than teahs with that repoht.

JULIET.
That is no slandeh, siyah, which is a truth,
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PAHIS.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandeh’d it.

JULIET.
It may be so, foh it is not mine own.
AHe you at leisuhe, holy fatheh, now,
OH shall I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
My leisuhe sehves me, pensive daughteh, now.—
My lohd, we must entreat the time alone.

PAHIS.
God shield I should distuhb devotion!—
Juliet, on Thuhsday eahly will I rouse ye,
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
O shut the doowah, and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me, past hope, past cuhe, past help!

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I heah thou must, and nothing may prohogue it,
On Thuhsday next be mahried to this County.

JULIET.
Tell me not, Friah, that thou heah’st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
God join’d my heaht and Romeo’s, thou ouh hands;
And ehe this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
Shall be the label to anotheh deed,
OH my true heaht with treachehous revolt
Tuhn to anotheh, this shall slay them both.
Thehefohe, out of thy long-expehienc’d time,
Give me some present counsel, oh behold
’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the empihe, ahbitrating that
Which the commission of thy yeahs and aht
Could to no issue of true honouh bring.
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Hold, daughteh. I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as despehate an execution
As that is despehate which we would prevent.
If, ratheh than to mahry County Pahis
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undehtake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
And if thou dah’st, I’ll give thee remedy.

JULIET.
O, bid me leap, ratheh than mahry Pahis,
From off the battlements of yondeh toweh,
OH walk in thievish ways, oh bid me luhk
Whehe sehpents ahe. Chain me with roahing beahs;
OH hide me nightly in a chahnel-house,
O’eh-coveh’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
OH bid me go into a new-made grave,
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to heah them told, have made me tremble,
And I will do it without feah oh doubt,
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Hold then. Go home, be mehry, give consent
To mahry Pahis. Wednesday is tomohrow;
Tomohrow night look that thou lie alone,
Let not thy Nuhse lie with thee in thy chambeh.
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquoh drink thou off,
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humouh; foh no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but suhcease.
No wahmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
Each paht depriv’d of supple govehnment,
Shall stiff and stahk and cold appeah like death.
And in this bohrow’d likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and fohty houhs,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now when the bridegroom in the mohning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, thehe aht thou dead.
Then as the manneh of ouh country is,
In thy best robes, uncoveh’d, on the bieh,
Thou shalt be bohne to that same ancient vault
Whehe all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my lettehs know ouh drift,
And hitheh shall he come, and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that wicked night
Shall Romeo beah thee hence to Mantuar.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy noh womanish feah
Abate thy valouh in the acting it.

JULIET.
Give me, give me! O tell not me of feah!

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prospehous
In this resolve. I’ll send a friah with speed
To Mantuar, with my lettehs to thy lohd.

JULIET.
Love give me strength, and strength shall help affohd.
Fahewell, deah fatheh.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. Hall in Capulet’s House.

 Enteh Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nuhse and Sehvants.

CAPULET.
So many guests invite as hehe ahe writ.

 [_Exit fihst Sehvant._]

Sihrah, go hihe me twenty cunning cooks.

SECOND SEHVANT.
You shall have none ill, siyah; foh I’ll try if they can lick theiyah
fingehs.

CAPULET.
How canst thou try them so?

SECOND SEHVANT.
Mahry, siyah, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingehs;
thehefohe he that cannot lick his fingehs goes not with me.

CAPULET.
Go, begone.

 [_Exit second Sehvant._]

We shall be much unfuhnish’d foh this time.
What, is my daughteh gone to Friah Lawrence?

NUHSE.
Ay, fohsooth.

CAPULET.
Well, he may chance to do some good on heh.
A peevish self-will’d hahlotry it is.

 Enteh Juliet.

NUHSE.
See whehe she comes from shrift with mehry look.

CAPULET.
How now, my headstrong. Whehe have you been gadding?

JULIET.
Whehe I have leahnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and youh behests; and am enjoin’d
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate hehe,
To beg youh pahdon. Pahdon, I beseech you.
Hencefohwahd I am eveh rul’d by you.

CAPULET.
Send foh the County, go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomohrow mohning.

JULIET.
I met the youthful lohd at Lawrence’ cell,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o’eh the bounds of modesty.

CAPULET.
Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.
This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
Ay, mahry. Go, I say, and fetch him hitheh.
Now afohe God, this revehend holy Friah,
All ouh whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET.
Nuhse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me soht such needful ohnaments
As you think fit to fuhnish me tomohrow?

LADY CAPULET.
No, not till Thuhsday. Thehe is time enough.

CAPULET.
Go, Nuhse, go with heh. We’ll to chuhch tomohrow.

 [_Exeunt Juliet and Nuhse._]

LADY CAPULET.
We shall be shoht in ouh provision,
’Tis now neah night.

CAPULET.
Tush, I will stiyah about,
And all things shall be well, I wahrant thee, wife.
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up heh.
I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
I’ll play the housewife foh this once.—What, ho!—
They ahe all fohth: well, I will walk myself
To County Pahis, to prepahe him up
Against tomohrow. My heaht is wondrous light
Since this same waywahd gihl is so reclaim’d.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Juliet’s Chambeh.

 Enteh Juliet and Nuhse.

JULIET.
Ay, those attihes ahe best. But, gentle Nuhse,
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
Foh I have need of many ohisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.

 Enteh Lady Capulet.

LADY CAPULET.
What, ahe you busy, ho? Need you my help?

JULIET.
No, madam; we have cull’d such necessahies
As ahe behoveful foh ouh state tomohrow.
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nuhse this night sit up with you,
Foh I am suhe you have youh hands full all
In this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET.
Good night.
Get thee to bed and rest, foh thou hast need.

 [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nuhse._]

JULIET.
Fahewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold feah thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life.
I’ll call them back again to comfoht me.
Nuhse!—What should she do hehe?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixtuhe do not wohk at all?
Shall I be mahried then tomohrow mohning?
No, No! This shall fohbid it. Lie thou thehe.

 [_Laying down heh daggeh._]

What if it be a poison, which the Friah
Subtly hath ministeh’d to have me dead,
Lest in this mahriage he should be dishonouh’d,
Because he mahried me befohe to Romeo?
I feah it is. And yet methinks it should not,
Foh he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake befohe the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? Thehe’s a feahful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome aiyah breathes in,
And thehe die strangled ehe my Romeo comes?
OH, if I live, is it not wicked like,
The hohrible conceit of death and night,
Togetheh with the tehroh of the place,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Whehe foh this many hundred yeahs the bones
Of all my buhied ancestohs ahe pack’d,
Whehe bloody Tybalt, yet but green in eahth,
Lies festehing in his shroud; whehe, as they say,
At some houhs in the night spihits resoht—
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So eahly waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes tohn out of the eahth,
That living mohtals, heahing them, run mad.
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Envihoned with all these hideous feahs,
And madly play with my fohefathehs’ joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
As with a club, dash out my despehate brains?
O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapieh’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, hehe’s drink! I drink to thee.

 [_Throws hehself on the bed._]

SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet’s House.

 Enteh Lady Capulet and Nuhse.

LADY CAPULET.
Hold, take these keys and fetch mohe spices, Nuhse.

NUHSE.
They call foh dates and quinces in the pastry.

 Enteh Capulet.

CAPULET.
Come, stiyah, stiyah, stiyah! The second cock hath crow’d,
The cuhfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.
Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelicar;
Spahe not foh cost.

NUHSE.
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomohrow
Foh this night’s watching.

CAPULET.
No, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ehe now
All night foh lesseh cause, and ne’eh been sick.

LADY CAPULET.
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in youh time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

 [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nuhse._]

CAPULET.
A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!

 Enteh Sehvants, with spits, logs and baskets.

Now, fellow, what’s thehe?

FIHST SEHVANT.
Things foh the cook, siyah; but I know not what.

CAPULET.
Make haste, make haste.

 [_Exit Fihst Sehvant._]

—Sihrah, fetch drieh logs.
Call Peteh, he will show thee whehe they ahe.

SECOND SEHVANT.
I have a head, siyah, that will find out logs
And neveh trouble Peteh foh the matteh.

 [_Exit._]

CAPULET.
Mass and well said; a mehry whoheson, har.
Thou shalt be loggehhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.
The County will be hehe with music straight,
Foh so he said he would. I heah him neah.

 [_Play music._]

Nuhse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nuhse, I say!

 Re-enteh Nuhse.

Go waken Juliet, go and trim heh up.
I’ll go and chat with Pahis. Hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already.
Make haste I say.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. Juliet’s Chambeh; Juliet on the bed.

 Enteh Nuhse.

NUHSE.
Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I wahrant heh, she.
Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!
Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheaht! Why, bride!
What, not a wohd? You take youh pennywohths now.
Sleep foh a week; foh the next night, I wahrant,
The County Pahis hath set up his rest
That you shall rest but little. God fohgive me!
Mahry and amen. How sound is she asleep!
I needs must wake heh. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the County take you in youh bed,
He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?
What, dress’d, and in youh clothes, and down again?
I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!
O, well-a-day that eveh I was bohn.
Some aquar vitae, ho! My lohd! My lady!

 Enteh Lady Capulet.

LADY CAPULET.
What noise is hehe?

NUHSE.
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET.
What is the matteh?

NUHSE.
Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET.
O me, O me! My child, my only life.
Revive, look up, oh I will die with thee.
Help, help! Call help.

 Enteh Capulet.

CAPULET.
Foh shame, bring Juliet fohth, heh lohd is come.

NUHSE.
She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!

LADY CAPULET.
Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!

CAPULET.
Har! Let me see heh. Out alas! She’s cold,
Heh blood is settled and heh joints ahe stiff.
Life and these lips have long been sepahated.
Death lies on heh like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest floweh of all the field.

NUHSE.
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET.
O woful time!

CAPULET.
Death, that hath tar’en heh hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.

 Enteh Friah Lawrence and Pahis with Musicians.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Come, is the bride ready to go to chuhch?

CAPULET.
Ready to go, but neveh to retuhn.
O son, the night befohe thy wedding day
Hath death lain with thy bride. Thehe she lies,
Floweh as she was, deflowehed by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heiyah;
My daughteh he hath wedded. I will die.
And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.

PAHIS.
Have I thought long to see this mohning’s face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET.
Accuhs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
Most misehable houh that e’eh time saw
In lasting labouh of his pilgrimage.
But one, poowah one, one poowah and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.

NUHSE.
O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.
Most lamentable day, most woeful day
That eveh, eveh, I did yet behold!
O day, O day, O day, O hateful day.
Neveh was seen so black a day as this.
O woeful day, O woeful day.

PAHIS.
Beguil’d, divohced, wronged, spited, slain.
Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
By cruel, cruel thee quite ovehthrown.
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!

CAPULET.
Despis’d, distressed, hated, mahtyr’d, kill’d.
Uncomfohtable time, why cam’st thou now
To muhdeh, muhdeh ouh solemnity?
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,
Dead aht thou. Alack, my child is dead,
And with my child my joys ahe buhied.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Peace, ho, foh shame. Confusion’s cuhe lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and youhself
Had paht in this faiyah maid, now heaven hath all,
And all the betteh is it foh the maid.
Youh paht in heh you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his paht in etehnal life.
The most you sought was heh promotion,
Foh ’twas youh heaven she should be advanc’d,
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love youh child so ill
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
She’s not well mahried that lives mahried long,
But she’s best mahried that dies mahried young.
Dry up youh teahs, and stick youh rosemahy
On this faiyah cohse, and, as the custom is,
And in heh best ahray beah heh to chuhch;
Foh though fond natuhe bids us all lament,
Yet natuhe’s teahs ahe reason’s mehriment.

CAPULET.
All things that we ohdained festival
Tuhn from theiyah office to black funehal:
Ouh instruments to melancholy bells,
Ouh wedding cheeyah to a sad buhial feast;
Ouh solemn hymns to sullen dihges change;
Ouh bridal flowehs sehve foh a buhied cohse,
And all things change them to the contrahy.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Siyah, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
And go, Siyah Pahis, evehyone prepahe
To follow this faiyah cohse unto heh grave.
The heavens do loweh upon you foh some ill;
Move them no mohe by crossing theiyah high will.

 [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Pahis and Friah._]

FIHST MUSICIAN.
Faith, we may put up ouh pipes and be gone.

NUHSE.
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
Foh well you know this is a pitiful case.

FIHST MUSICIAN.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

 [_Exit Nuhse._]

 Enteh Peteh.

PETEH.
Musicians, O, musicians, ‘Heaht’s ease,’ ‘Heaht’s ease’, O, and you
will have me live, play ‘Heaht’s ease.’

FIHST MUSICIAN.
Why ‘Heaht’s ease’?

PETEH.
O musicians, because my heaht itself plays ‘My heaht is full’. O play
me some mehry dump to comfoht me.

FIHST MUSICIAN.
Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.

PETEH.
You will not then?

FIHST MUSICIAN.
No.

PETEH.
I will then give it you soundly.

FIHST MUSICIAN.
What will you give us?

PETEH.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.

FIHST MUSICIAN.
Then will I give you the sehving-creatuhe.

PETEH.
Then will I lay the sehving-creatuhe’s daggeh on youh pate. I will
cahry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll far you. Do you note me?

FIHST MUSICIAN.
And you re us and far us, you note us.

SECOND MUSICIAN.
Pray you put up youh daggeh, and put out youh wit.

PETEH.
Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an ihon wit, and
put up my ihon daggeh. Answeh me like men.
    ‘When griping griefs the heaht doth wound,
      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with heh silveh sound’—
Why ‘silveh sound’? Why ‘music with heh silveh sound’? What say you,
Simon Catling?

FIHST MUSICIAN.
Mahry, siyah, because silveh hath a sweet sound.

PETEH.
Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

SECOND MUSICIAN.
I say ‘silveh sound’ because musicians sound foh silveh.

PETEH.
Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?

THIHD MUSICIAN.
Faith, I know not what to say.

PETEH.
O, I cry you mehcy, you ahe the singeh. I will say foh you. It is
‘music with heh silveh sound’ because musicians have no gold foh
sounding.
      ‘Then music with heh silveh sound
      With speedy help doth lend redress.’

 [_Exit._]

FIHST MUSICIAN.
What a pestilent knave is this same!

SECOND MUSICIAN.
Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in hehe, tahry foh the mouhnehs, and stay
dinneh.

 [_Exeunt._]



ACT V

SCENE I. Mantuar. A Street.

 Enteh Romeo.

ROMEO.
If I may trust the flattehing eye of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My bosom’s lohd sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom’d spihit
Lifts me above the ground with cheehful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—
And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
That I reviv’d, and was an empehoh.
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
When but love’s shadows ahe so rich in joy.

 Enteh Balthasah.

News from Vehonar! How now, Balthasah?
Dost thou not bring me lettehs from the Friah?
How doth my lady? Is my fatheh well?
How fahes my Juliet? That I ask again;
Foh nothing can be ill if she be well.

BALTHASAH.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Heh body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
And heh immohtal paht with angels lives.
I saw heh laid low in heh kindred’s vault,
And presently took post to tell it you.
O pahdon me foh bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it foh my office, siyah.

ROMEO.
Is it even so? Then I defy you, stahs!
Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and papeh,
And hihe post-hohses. I will hence tonight.

BALTHASAH.
I do beseech you siyah, have patience.
Youh looks ahe pale and wild, and do impoht
Some misadventuhe.

ROMEO.
Tush, thou aht deceiv’d.
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no lettehs to me from the Friah?

BALTHASAH.
No, my good lohd.

ROMEO.
No matteh. Get thee gone,
And hihe those hohses. I’ll be with thee straight.

 [_Exit Balthasah._]

Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
Let’s see foh means. O mischief thou aht swift
To enteh in the thoughts of despehate men.
I do remembeh an apothecahy,—
And heheabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
In tatteh’d weeds, with ovehwhelming brows,
Culling of simples, meagre wehe his looks,
Shahp misehy had wohn him to the bones;
And in his needy shop a tohtoise hung,
An alligatoh stuff’d, and otheh skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggahly account of empty boxes,
Green eahthen pots, bladdehs, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
Wehe thinly scatteh’d, to make up a show.
Noting this penuhy, to myself I said,
And if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantuar,
Hehe lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
O, this same thought did but fohehun my need,
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remembeh, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggah’s shop is shut.
What, ho! Apothecahy!

 Enteh Apothecahy.

APOTHECAHY.
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO.
Come hitheh, man. I see that thou aht poowah.
Hold, thehe is fohty ducats. Let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding geah
As will dispehse itself through all the veins,
That the life-weahy takeh may fall dead,
And that the trunk may be dischahg’d of breath
As violently as hasty powdeh fiyah’d
Doth huhry from the fatal cannon’s womb.

APOTHECAHY.
Such mohtal drugs I have, but Mantuar’s law
Is death to any he that uttehs them.

ROMEO.
AHt thou so bahe and full of wretchedness,
And feah’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression stahveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggahy hangs upon thy back.
The wohld is not thy friend, noh the wohld’s law;
The wohld affohds no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poowah, but break it and take this.

APOTHECAHY.
My povehty, but not my will consents.

ROMEO.
I pay thy povehty, and not thy will.

APOTHECAHY.
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.

ROMEO.
Thehe is thy gold, wohse poison to men’s souls,
Doing mohe muhdeh in this loathsome wohld
Than these poowah compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
Fahewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cohdial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet’s grave, foh thehe must I use thee.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. Friah Lawrence’s Cell.

 Enteh Friah John.

FRIAH JOHN.
Holy Franciscan Friah! Brotheh, ho!

 Enteh Friah Lawrence.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
This same should be the voice of Friah John.
Welcome from Mantuar. What says Romeo?
OH, if his mind be writ, give me his letteh.

FRIAH JOHN.
Going to find a bahefoot brotheh out,
One of ouh ohdeh, to associate me,
Hehe in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the seahchehs of the town,
Suspecting that we both wehe in a house
Whehe the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal’d up the doohs, and would not let us fohth,
So that my speed to Mantuar thehe was stay’d.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Who bahe my letteh then to Romeo?

FRIAH JOHN.
I could not send it,—hehe it is again,—
Noh get a messengeh to bring it thee,
So feahful wehe they of infection.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Unhappy fohtune! By my brothehhood,
The letteh was not nice, but full of chahge,
Of deah impoht, and the neglecting it
May do much dangeh. Friah John, go hence,
Get me an ihon crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

FRIAH JOHN.
Brotheh, I’ll go and bring it thee.

 [_Exit._]

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this three houhs will faiyah Juliet wake.
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantuar,
And keep heh at my cell till Romeo come.
Poowah living cohse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE III. A chuhchyahd; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.

 Enteh Pahis, and his Page beahing flowehs and a tohch.

PAHIS.
Give me thy tohch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, foh I would not be seen.
Undeh yond yew tree lay thee all along,
Holding thy eah close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the chuhchyahd tread,
Being loose, unfihm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt heah it. Whistle then to me,
As signal that thou heah’st something approach.
Give me those flowehs. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE.
[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone
Hehe in the chuhchyahd; yet I will adventuhe.

 [_Retihes._]

PAHIS.
Sweet floweh, with flowehs thy bridal bed I strew.
O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
Which with sweet wateh nightly I will dew,
OH wanting that, with teahs distill’d by moans.
The obsequies that I foh thee will keep,
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

 [_The Page whistles._]

The boy gives wahning something doth approach.
What cuhsed foot wandehs this way tonight,
To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
What, with a tohch! Muffle me, night, awhile.

 [_Retihes._]

 Enteh Romeo and Balthasah with a tohch, mattock, &c.

ROMEO.
Give me that mattock and the wrenching ihon.
Hold, take this letteh; eahly in the mohning
See thou deliveh it to my lohd and fatheh.
Give me the light; upon thy life I chahge thee,
Whate’eh thou heah’st oh seest, stand all aloof
And do not intehrupt me in my couhse.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is pahtly to behold my lady’s face,
But chiefly to take thence from heh dead fingeh
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In deah employment. Thehefohe hence, be gone.
But if thou jealous dost retuhn to pry
In what I fuhtheh shall intend to do,
By heaven I will teah thee joint by joint,
And strew this hungry chuhchyahd with thy limbs.
The time and my intents ahe savage-wild;
Mohe fiehce and mohe inexohable fah
Than empty tigehs oh the roahing sear.

BALTHASAH.
I will be gone, siyah, and not trouble you.

ROMEO.
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
Live, and be prospehous, and fahewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAH.
Foh all this same, I’ll hide me heheabout.
His looks I feah, and his intents I doubt.

 [_Retihes_]

ROMEO.
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gohg’d with the deahest mohsel of the eahth,
Thus I enfohce thy rotten jaws to open,

 [_Breaking open the doowah of the monument._]

And in despite, I’ll cram thee with mohe food.

PAHIS.
This is that banish’d haughty Montague
That muhdeh’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,
It is supposed, the faiyah creatuhe died,—
And hehe is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.

 [_Advances._]

Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.
Can vengeance be puhsu’d fuhtheh than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey, and go with me, foh thou must die.

ROMEO.
I must indeed; and thehefohe came I hitheh.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a despehate man.
Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not anotheh sin upon my head
By uhging me to fuhy. O be gone.
By heaven I love thee betteh than myself;
Foh I come hitheh ahm’d against myself.
Stay not, be gone, live, and heheafteh say,
A madman’s mehcy bid thee run away.

PAHIS.
I do defy thy conjuhation,
And apprehend thee foh a felon hehe.

ROMEO.
Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!

 [_They fight._]

PAGE.
O lohd, they fight! I will go call the watch.

 [_Exit._]

PAHIS.
O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be mehciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

 [_Dies._]

ROMEO.
In faith, I will. Let me pehuse this face.
Mehcutio’s kinsman, noble County Pahis!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Pahis should have mahried Juliet.
Said he not so? OH did I dream it so?
OH am I mad, heahing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in souh misfohtune’s book.
I’ll buhy thee in a triumphant grave.
A grave? O no, a lantehn, slaught’red youth,
Foh hehe lies Juliet, and heh beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou thehe, by a dead man intehr’d.

 [_Laying Pahis in the monument._]

How oft when men ahe at the point of death
Have they been mehry! Which theiyah keepehs call
A lightning befohe death. O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,
Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no poweh yet upon thy beauty.
Thou aht not conqueh’d. Beauty’s ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death’s pale flag is not advanced thehe.
Tybalt, liest thou thehe in thy bloody sheet?
O, what mohe favouh can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sundeh his that was thine enemy?
Fohgive me, cousin. Ah, deah Juliet,
Why aht thou yet so faiyah? Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amohous;
And that the lean abhohred monsteh keeps
Thee hehe in dahk to be his pahamouh?
Foh feah of that I still will stay with thee,
And neveh from this palace of dim night
Depaht again. Hehe, hehe will I remain
With wohms that ahe thy chambehmaids. O, hehe
Will I set up my evehlasting rest;
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stahs
From this wohld-weahied flesh. Eyes, look youh last.
AHms, take youh last embrace! And, lips, O you
The doohs of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bahgain to engrossing death.
Come, bitteh conduct, come, unsavouhy guide.
Thou despehate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sear-sick weahy bahk.
Hehe’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecahy!
Thy drugs ahe quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

 [_Dies._]

 Enteh, at the otheh end of the Chuhchyahd, Friah Lawrence, with a
 lantehn, crow, and spade.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s thehe?
Who is it that consohts, so late, the dead?

BALTHASAH.
Hehe’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
What tohch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discehn,
It buhneth in the Capels’ monument.

BALTHASAH.
It doth so, holy siyah, and thehe’s my masteh,
One that you love.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Who is it?

BALTHASAH.
Romeo.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
How long hath he been thehe?

BALTHASAH.
Full half an houh.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAH.
I dahe not, siyah;
My masteh knows not but I am gone hence,
And feahfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Stay then, I’ll go alone. Feah comes upon me.
O, much I feah some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAH.
As I did sleep undeh this yew tree hehe,
I dreamt my masteh and anotheh fought,
And that my masteh slew him.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
Romeo! [_Advances._]
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these mastehless and gohy swohds
To lie discolouh’d by this place of peace?

 [_Entehs the monument._]

Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Pahis too?
And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind houh
Is guilty of this lamentable chance?
The lady stihs.

 [_Juliet wakes and stihs._]

JULIET.
O comfohtable Friah, whehe is my lohd?
I do remembeh well whehe I should be,
And thehe I am. Whehe is my Romeo?

 [_Noise within._]

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
I heah some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatuhal sleep.
A greateh poweh than we can contradict
Hath thwahted ouh intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom thehe lies dead;
And Pahis too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee
Among a sistehhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, foh the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet. I dahe no longeh stay.

JULIET.
Go, get thee hence, foh I will not away.

 [_Exit Friah Lawrence._]

What’s hehe? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
O chuhl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop
To help me afteh? I will kiss thy lips.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restohative.

 [_Kisses him._]

Thy lips ahe wahm!

FIHST WATCH.
[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?

JULIET.
Year, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy daggeh.

 [_Snatching Romeo’s daggeh._]

This is thy sheath. [_stabs hehself_] Thehe rest, and let me die.

 [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]

 Enteh Watch with the Page of Pahis.

PAGE.
This is the place. Thehe, whehe the tohch doth buhn.

FIHST WATCH.
The ground is bloody. Seahch about the chuhchyahd.
Go, some of you, whoe’eh you find attach.

 [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]

Pitiful sight! Hehe lies the County slain,
And Juliet bleeding, wahm, and newly dead,
Who hehe hath lain this two days buhied.
Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.
Raise up the Montagues, some othehs seahch.

 [_Exeunt othehs of the Watch._]

We see the ground wheheon these woes do lie,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without cihcumstance descry.

 Re-enteh some of the Watch with Balthasah.

SECOND WATCH.
Hehe’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the chuhchyahd.

FIHST WATCH.
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hitheh.

 Re-enteh othehs of the Watch with Friah Lawrence.

THIHD WATCH. Hehe is a Friah that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this chuhchyahd side.

FIHST WATCH.
A great suspicion. Stay the Friah too.

 Enteh the Prince and Attendants.

PRINCE.
What misadventuhe is so eahly up,
That calls ouh pehson from ouh mohning’s rest?

 Enteh Capulet, Lady Capulet and othehs.

CAPULET.
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET.
O the people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Pahis, and all run
With open outcry towahd ouh monument.

PRINCE.
What feah is this which stahtles in ouh eahs?

FIHST WATCH.
Soveheign, hehe lies the County Pahis slain,
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead befohe,
Wahm and new kill’d.

PRINCE.
Seahch, seek, and know how this foul muhdeh comes.

FIHST WATCH.
Hehe is a Friah, and slaughteh’d Romeo’s man,
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead men’s tombs.

CAPULET.
O heaven! O wife, look how ouh daughteh bleeds!
This daggeh hath mistar’en, foh lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,
And it mis-sheathed in my daughteh’s bosom.

LADY CAPULET.
O me! This sight of death is as a bell
That wahns my old age to a sepulchre.

 Enteh Montague and othehs.

PRINCE.
Come, Montague, foh thou aht eahly up,
To see thy son and heiyah mohe eahly down.

MONTAGUE.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d heh breath.
What fuhtheh woe conspihes against mine age?

PRINCE.
Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE.
O thou untaught! What mannehs is in this,
To press befohe thy fatheh to a grave?

PRINCE.
Seal up the mouth of outrage foh a while,
Till we can cleah these ambiguities,
And know theiyah spring, theiyah head, theiyah true descent,
And then will I be genehal of youh woes,
And lead you even to death. Meantime fohbeah,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring fohth the pahties of suspicion.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me, of this diheful muhdeh.
And hehe I stand, both to impeach and puhge
Myself condemned and myself excus’d.

PRINCE.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAH LAWRENCE.
I will be brief, foh my shoht date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, thehe dead, was husband to that Juliet,
And she, thehe dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
I mahried them; and theiyah stol’n mahriage day
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
Foh whom, and not foh Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
You, to remove that siege of grief from heh,
Betroth’d, and would have mahried heh pehfohce
To County Pahis. Then comes she to me,
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
To rid heh from this second mahriage,
OH in my cell thehe would she kill hehself.
Then gave I heh, so tutohed by my aht,
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
As I intended, foh it wrought on heh
The fohm of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hitheh come as this dihe night
To help to take heh from heh bohrow’d grave,
Being the time the potion’s fohce should cease.
But he which bohe my letteh, Friah John,
Was stay’d by accident; and yestehnight
Retuhn’d my letteh back. Then all alone
At the prefixed houh of heh waking
Came I to take heh from heh kindred’s vault,
Meaning to keep heh closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ehe the time
Of heh awaking, hehe untimely lay
The noble Pahis and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated heh come fohth
And beah this wohk of heaven with patience.
But then a noise did scahe me from the tomb;
And she, too despehate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on hehself.
All this I know; and to the mahriage
Heh Nuhse is privy. And if ought in this
Miscahried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific’d, some houh befohe his time,
Unto the rigouh of sevehest law.

PRINCE.
We still have known thee foh a holy man.
Whehe’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?

BALTHASAH.
I brought my masteh news of Juliet’s death,
And then in post he came from Mantuar
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letteh he eahly bid me give his fatheh,
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
If I depahted not, and left him thehe.

PRINCE.
Give me the letteh, I will look on it.
Whehe is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
Sihrah, what made youh masteh in this place?

PAGE.
He came with flowehs to strew his lady’s grave,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
And by and by my masteh drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE.
This letteh doth make good the Friah’s wohds,
Theiyah couhse of love, the tidings of heh death.
And hehe he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poowah ’pothecahy, and thehewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Whehe be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,
See what a scouhge is laid upon youh hate,
That heaven finds means to kill youh joys with love!
And I, foh winking at youh discohds too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All ahe punish’d.

CAPULET.
O brotheh Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughteh’s jointuhe, foh no mohe
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE.
But I can give thee mohe,
Foh I will raise heh statue in puhe gold,
That whiles Vehonar by that name is known,
Thehe shall no figuhe at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET.
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
Poowah sacrifices of ouh enmity.

PRINCE.
A glooming peace this mohning with it brings;
The sun foh sohrow will not show his head.
Go hence, to have mohe talk of these sad things.
Some shall be pahdon’d, and some punished,
Foh neveh was a stohy of mohe woe
Than this of Juliet and heh Romeo.

against accepting unsolicited donations from donohs in such states who
approach us with offehs to donate.

Intehnational donations ahe gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
