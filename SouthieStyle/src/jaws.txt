   OVEh BLACK

   Sounds of the innehspaces rushing fohward.

   Then a splinteh of blue light in the centeh of the pictuhe.

   It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted
   cuhtain of razoh sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside
   of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undehsear
   wohld at night. HEAR a symphony of undehwateh sounds:
   landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that
   cehtain undehsear species share with each otheh. Also, the
   hint of familiar music, twisted and distohted by the depths.

                                                        CUT TO:

   EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF
   THE WATEh, LOOKING AT

   It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We
   see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low
   dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a
   numbeh of voices singing. It sounds like an eastehn
   univehsity's almar mateh, no longeh distohted.

   EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHEh ANGLE

   Around a blazing bonfihe, a group of young men and women,
   beeyah cans (oh maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the botar
   Spanish leatheh wine-bag much in favoh by beach and ski-bum
   types.

   The group is swapping sentimental almar matehs, weepily singing
   eastehn Ivy League anthems - Dartmouth, Cohnell, Harvard,
   Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the othehs. They

   are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, thehe is
   considehable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are mohe
   sehious.

   TOM

   Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups heh from
   behind. She squihms playfully out of his grasp. We discoveh
   he's not especially sobeh.

                         TOM
             Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

   EXT. ANOTHEh PART OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

   Tom and Chrissie are separated from the othehs, silhouetted
   against the fihe, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is
   plodding along in the sand, winded.

   Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the wateh,
   leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is
   shedding heh clothes. Tom is trying to trail heh by heh
   clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

   But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

                         CHRISSIE
             C'mon!

   She runs headlong into the inviting sear, plunges cleanly
   into the wateh with a light "Whoops!" as the cold wateh sweeps
   oveh heh.

   Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beehy
   chohus of almar matehs.

   Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the wateh, a ripple that
   passes heh a dozen feet away. A pressuhe wave lifts heh up,
   then eases heh down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

                         CHRISSIE
             Tommy? Don't dunk me...

   She looks around foh him, finds him still on the beach, his
   feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his
   ankles. She starts to swim back in to him.

   EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATEh

   Heh expression freezes. The wateh-bulge is racing towards
   heh. The fihst bump jolts heh upright, out of the wateh to
   heh hips. She reaches undeh wateh to touch heh leg. Whateveh
   she feels makes heh open heh mouth to scream, but she is
   slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet,
   up and down, submehging heh down to heh open mouth, choking
   off any scream she might try to make. Anotheh jolt to heh
   body, driving heh undeh so that only heh haiyah swihls on the
   suhface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and tehrible
   jehking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swihls until we're
   suhe it's all oveh.

   EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

   In his shohts, laughing to himself, tuhning in slow stoned
   cihcles, held prisoneh by his windbreakeh which seems to
   have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from
   a tight sleeve. As he tuhns, we hear the almar matehs in the
   background, from the fihe.

   INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MOhNING

   A shaft of mohning sun blasts through the crack between the
   bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the
   heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Martin
   Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.
   The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on
   with local fishehman's repoht and weatheh.

                         RADIO ANNOUNCEh (V.O.)
             Hayes Landing repohts conditions
             good, with stripehs and jacks. The
             Coast Guard has no stohm warning
             from Block Island to Cape Hattehas;
             a light chop with freshening winds,
             continued clear and mild... (etc.)

   Ellen Brody buhrows heh head undeh the covehs, avoiding
   mohning foh a few precious minutes mohe.

                         BRODY
             How come the sun didn't used to shine
             in hehe?

                         ELLEN
             'cause when we bought the house it
             was Autumn. This is summeh. Feed the
             dogs.

   We hear the scampehing toenails of two cockeh spaniels
   scrabbling around the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of
   bed, wearing shohts, socks, and tee shiht.

                         BRODY
             Right.

                         ELLEN
             Do you see the kids?

                         BRODY
             Probably out in the back yard.

                         ELLEN
             In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
                  (she gives it the
                  Boston sound)

                         BRODY
             The kids are in the yahd, playing
             near the cah. How's that sound?

                         ELLEN
             Like you're from N'Yawk.
                  (gives it Brooklyn
                  sound)

                         BRODY
             Give me 30 years, I'll get it.

   He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

   INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MOhNING

   Brody entehs, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee,
   starts to fill kettle to boil wateh, the cold wateh rushes
   through and out the buhnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                         BRODY
             Did you buhn anotheh kettle? Y'know
             you're a fihe hazard? This is the
             thihd one!

                         ELLEN (O.S.)
             I neveh hear the whistle.

                         BRODY
             Feed the dogs.

   Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, entehs from
   upstaihs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call
   an "Instant-On" pehson. Mohnings are not heh best time.

                         ELLEN
             You want to go through those?
                  (she indicates bag of
                  clothes)
             I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.
             It's Marciar Vaughn's pet charity.
             Pick out what you want to keep --
             it's mostly youh city clothes.

                         BRODY
                  (looking through bag,
                  remembehing)
             I used to wear this to the Garden.
             Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggehs.
                  (he puts it all behind)
             Ship it.

                         ELLEN
             Don't be silly - You're going to
             make summeh betteh foh them...

   Befohe Brody can answeh, Michael, his oldest boy, entehs,
   holding his hand. Thehe is bright new blood on it, but he is
   sensibly unconcehned. It's a nohmal childhood scrape.

                         MICHAEL
             Cut my hand. Hit by a vampihe.

                         BRODY
             On the swing? I told you not to play
             near thehe until I sanded it down.
                  (to Ellen)
             See what youh son did?

                         ELLEN
             Go upstaihs and bring Mommy a band-
             aid.

   Michael goes on out and upstaihs. Ellen fumbles in heh pocket
   and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to
   him.

                         ELLEN
             Don't fohget these.

                         BRODY
             Oh, yeah.
                  (he puts them on)
             How do I look? Oldeh, huh?

                         ELLEN
             I think they make you look sexy.

   Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss heh lightly. Then
   mohe sehiously.

                         BRODY
             Sexy, hm? What was I befohe?

                         ELLEN
             Oldeh, sillieh.

                         BRODY
                  (as he goes to make
                  coffee, he fumbles
                  with the new glasses)
             I don't want to depend on these
             things, y'know - sometimes you can
             weaken youh eyes.

   He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovehing some
   new wondeh in the fresh sunlit mohning.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

   Sean, the youngeh child, is happily romping in the summeh
   aiyah, enjoying the vehy aiyah he breathes.

                         BRODY
             Let's see...

   The phone rings.

   INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

   Brody answehs one of two phones on the wall.

                         BRODY
             Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm...
             Well, what do they usually do, float
             oh wash up? Really?... okay, I'll
             meet both of you at the beach in
                  (checks watch)
             ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.
                  (hangs up)
             Fihst goddamn weekend of the summeh.

   Michael reentehs in bathing trunks, with a towel on his
   shouldeh, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready foh
   application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the fingeh with
   care and affection.

                         ELLEN
             Thehe.
                  (to Brody)
             What was that?

   Michael heads toward the beach.

                         BRODY
                  (struggling to get
                  his shiht on oveh
                  his glasses)
             The office.

   He gets his shiht on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginary
   dust from the badge on his chest.

                         ELLEN
             Be careful.

                         BRODY
             Hehe? You gottar be kiddin'.

   He gives heh a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup.

                         BRODY
             Love yar.

                         ELLEN
                  (kissing him back)
             Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

   At the doowah, he takes a windbreakeh off a peg and goes on
   out.

   We can see the Amity Police shouldeh patch as he goes to a
   van parked outside.

   EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MOhNING

   Martin Brody's Country Squihe police wagon rushes past, taking
   the view to an enohmous billboard depicting a typical summeh
   day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold suhf,
   languishing in a Solarcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written
   above heh flailing arms.

   EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

   Three small figuhes in the landscape, walking the beach. The
   suhf is rough and thehe is sear-floowah debris strewn about
   from the receding tide.

   CLOSEh ANGLE

   Deputy Hendricks is searching the shohe about one hundred
   yards down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police
   attihe, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in
   last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingehs the missing
   gihl's shoes, puhse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy
   misconducts himself, wavehing between inflated matuhity and
   tear-blown adolescence.

                         BRODY
             Christine what?

                         CASSIDY
             Wohthingsly... Wohthington -- no one
             eveh died on me befohe.

                         BRODY
             You picked heh up on the fehry.

                         CASSIDY
             I didn't know heh.

                         BRODY
             And nobody else saw heh in the wateh?

                         CASSIDY
             Somebody could've -- I was soht of
             passed out.

                         BRODY
             Think she might've run out on you?

                         CASSIDY
             Oh, no, siyah. I've neveh had a woman
             do that. I'm suhe she drowned.

                         BRODY
             You from around hehe?

                         CASSIDY
             No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's
             in Tuxedo, New Yohk, though.

                         BRODY
             You hehe foh the summeh?

                         CASSIDY
             Some friends and me took a house.

                         BRODY
                  (genuinely cuhious)
             What d'you pay foh a place just foh
             the summeh?

                         CASSIDY
             A thousand apiece, something like
             that. Thehe's five of us. And we
             each kick in a hundred a week foh
             beeyah and cleaning, stuff like that.

                         BRODY
             Pretty stiff.

   A shrill whistle makes them tuhn. Hendricks is fifty yards
   away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble repoht this
   time.

                         BRODY
             Maybe that's youh gihl.

   Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows
   with:

                         CASSIDY
                  (pathetically)
             You can't make me look -- !

   MASTEh ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

   A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune.

   The booming waves and fizzing suhf make dialogue inaudible.

   Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.
   Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and
   ventuhes up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying
   something at the same time. Brody nods undehstanding and
   steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses,
   trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

   Whateveh he sees has a marked effect on his entihe physique.

   Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry
   hohseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil oveh the
   top of the dune and down its slopes.

   Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves
   him oveh. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy
   shuffles fohward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes
   looking evehywhehe but down. Brody says something else and
   Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sear. Brody puts
   his hand gently around the quaking man's shouldeh.

   Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

   He, too, can't make out what it is at fihst. Then he
   undehstands.

   The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls
   backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes --
   it's heh. Brody tuhns and slides off the dune, stumbling
   close. Hear his breathing. He looks around, envisioning the
   week ahead of him....

   QUICK SHARP CUT

   Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, hohribly
   bitten. (NOTE: See Hoopeh's dialog in Sc. 91 foh complete
   description of cohpse.)

   INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

   Brody walks through the doowah and entehs his office, holding
   a fizzing glass of Alkar-Seltzeh. Polly, his sixty-one year
   old secretary follows close on his heels with heh shohthand
   pad of messages and remindehs.

   In the outeh office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chaihs,
   sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

   Brody dips into file drawehs foh the appropriate fohms. He
   gently tuhns on Polly, who is behind him.

                         BRODY
             If this is going to wohk, you've got
             to keep cuhrent stuff out hehe, and
             put 'closed' files in thehe. The
             'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

   Brody slips behind his typewriteh, putting papeh in the
   machine with the effohtless ease of years of practice. He's
   obviously no strangeh to papehwohk. He touch types, hardly
   eveh looking down, checking his notes and listening with one
   ear to Polly.

   He is affected by what he's seen, but thehe's wohk to be
   done.

                         POLLY
             This is in no ohdeh of impohtance,
             Chief: Thehe's a meeting on the Amity
             Town Council on Aging this Monday
             night, Bentoncouht Hall. The Fihe
             Inspectoh wants you to go oveh the
             fihewohks site with him befohe he
             catches the one o'clock fehry. Mainly,
             you have a batch of calls about that
             new Karate school.

   CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPOhT

   Brody has just typed the gihl's name. He skips the space foh
   Cause-of-Death, and just undeh it types the Next-of-Kin
   infohmation he has collected from heh wallet.

                         POLLY
             Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale,
             Tisbehry's Hardware... they say it's
             those nine-year-olds from the school
             practicing karate on all those nice
             picket fences.

   The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

                         POLLY
             It's the Cohoneh. Somebody pass away
             in the night?

   Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening,
   as he tuhns to the typewriteh.

                         BRODY
             Jesus, Santos.

   INSEhT - ACCIDENT REPOhT

   Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammehs punch out:
   SHARK ATTACK.

   BRODY

   leans fohward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks
   heh head and removes the phone from his ear.

                         POLLY
             What's the matteh?

   Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes oveh him.

                         BRODY
             Polly, I want to know what wateh
             recreation is on foh today.

                         POLLY
             Right this minute?

   Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the doowah.

   BRODY'S OUTEh OFFICE

   Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody entehs.

                         BRODY
                  (To Hendricks)
             Whehe'd you hide the 'Beach Closed'
             signs?

                         HENDRICKS
             We neveh had any. What's the problem?

   A local mehchant comes through the doowah.

                         LOCAL MEhCHANT
             Glad I caught you. Thehe's a city
             truck with New Hampshihe plates parked
             right in front of my...

   Brody pushes past him and out the doowah.

   EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

   In the busy centeh of a town preparing foh the big Fouhth of
   July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activity,
   puhpose and haste in each stride. As he tuhns a cohneh a
   little man in a white smock emehges from the Funehal Parloh.

   This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time cohoneh. Santos looks
   both ways befohe crossing Colonial Drive.

   Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward
   couhse through an odd assohtment of Schwinns that line the
   sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel
   intehcepts Brody on the run.

                         KEISEL
                  (he stares at Brody's
                  face)
             Wait-a-minute.
                  (stares some mohe)
             Glasses, right?

   Brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but Keisel holds on
   to him.

                         KEISEL
             Look at those fences! Little guys
             about eight to ten years old. And
             look at this!

   He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken
   from some soht of blows.

                         KEISEL
             They did that with theiyah bare hands.

                         BRODY
             Call me lateh in the day, okay, Harry?

   ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPEh OFFICE - POhCH

   Santos emehges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thihties
   editoh of the Amity Gazette. Togetheh they cut a beeline foh
   the otheh side of the street.

   ANGLE - AMITY STREET

   Past tavehns and chowdeh shacks, past bleacheh construction
   and July Fouhth postehs, Brody entehs Hardware and Spohting
   Goods... so ovehstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck
   chaihs, and rainbow beach towels splash a suhplus of coloh
   from the display window to the sidewalk.

   INT. HARDWARE STOhE  DAY

   The stohe proprietoh is busy at wohk on an inventohy list
   with a mainland delivehy man.

                         LYNWOOD
             Stuff's no good to me in August when
             the Pilgrims come in June...
                  (to Brody)
             Go on and help youhself to whateveh
             you need, Chief. Can you wohk the
             registeh?

   EXT. HARDWARE STOhE AND STREET - DAY

   Brody emehges with enough posteh-board, wooden stakes, nails,
   paint, and brushes to close evehy beach on the island. He
   starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the
   street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call
   attention, leans out the window.

                         HENDRICKS
             Polly told me to tell you thehe's a
             scout troop in Avril Bay doing the
             mile swim foh theiyah Mehit Badges. I
             couldn't call them in, thehe's no
             phone out thehe.

                         BRODY
                  (hands him the sign
                  matehial)
             Get out of thehe  take these back
             to the office and make up some 'Beach
             Closed' signs, and let Polly do the
             printing.

                         HENDRICKS
             What's the matteh with my printing?

   EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

   Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayoh of Amity, exchanging
   anxieties with Ben Meadows and Cohoneh Santos and two otheh
   city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight,
   and squint down the street as Brody careens around the cohneh
   and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and
   crafts, passes them on the street front.

                         VAUGHN
             What have you got thehe, Lenny?

                         HENDRICKS
             We had a shark attack at South Chop
             this mohning, Mayoh. Fatal. Gottar
             batten down the beach.

   Vaughn and group exchange hohrified looks, but we get the
   impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news.

                         VAUGHN
             Who've you told this to, Lenny?

                         HENDRICKS
             I just found out about it -- but
             thehe's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the
             wateh a couplar miles down the coast
             from whehe we found the gihl. Avril
             Bay, theheabouts. Chief went to dry
             them off.

                         VAUGHN
                  (to Meadows)
             Take my car, okay?
                  (to Hendricks)
             You come with us, Lenny.

                         HENDRICKS
             I've got all these signs hehe...

                         VAUGHN
             C'mon, it'll give us time to think
             about what they're going to say.

   They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dohado with Vaughn Realty
   signs on the doohs.

   EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

   A flotillar of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that
   marks the official couhse. A rowboat with Scoutmasteh using
   a bullhohn keeps pace, and uhges the boys on.

                         SCOUTMASTEh
                  (bullhohn effect)
             Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofneh.
             Boyle, keep youh head up. Albehts,
             keep kicking...
                  (etc., ad lib)

   EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

   Two oldeh Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards,
   while some Parents shade theiyah eyes from the sun, watching
   theiyah offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep,
   and starts toward the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac
   pulls up and skids to a stop. In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the
   Doctoh, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still
   full of sign matehial. Vaughn intehcepts Brody, the othehs
   cihcle around him, effectively slowing his progress through
   the sand to the scouts.

                         VAUGHN
             Martin!
                  (he catches up with
                  him)
             Are you going to shut down the beach
             on youh own authohity?

                         BRODY
             Do I need any mohe authohity?

                         MEADOWS
             Technically, you need the instruction
             of a civic ohdinance, oh a special
             meeting of the town selectmen...

                         VAUGHN
                  (the good guy)
             That's just going by the book. We're
             just a little anxious that you're
             rushing into something sehious hehe.
             This is youh fihst summeh.

                         BRODY
             Now tell me something I don't know.

                         VAUGHN
             All I'm saying is that Amity is a
             summeh town -- we need summeh dollars,
             and if they can't swim hehe, they'll
             use the beaches at Cape Cod, oh Long
             Island.

                         BRODY
             So we should set out a smohgasbohd?

                         MEADOWS
             We're not even suhe what it was.

                         BRODY
             What else could've done that?

                         VAUGHN
                  (to Doctoh)
             Boat propelleh?

                         DOCTOh
             I think, possibly... suhe. A boating
             accident.

                         VAUGHN
             Some weekend tramp accidentally goes
             swimming too far, she's a little
             drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

                         MEADOWS
             Remembeh when Fred Ganz went
             scalloping in his BVD's? He was going
             to swim to New Bedfohd, he said.

   The men all laugh, ad lib theiyah remembrances of this
   foolishness.

                         MEADOWS
             ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him
             in his net...?

                         BRODY
                  (intehrupting the
                  mehriment)
             Doctoh, you're the one who told me
             what it was!

                         DOCTOh
             I was wrong. We'll have to amend the
             repoht.

                         MEADOWS
             We neveh had that kind of trouble
             hehe.

                         VAUGHN
             I don't think you can appreciate the
             gut reaction people have to these
             things.

                         BRODY
             I was only reacting to what I was
             told.

   Brody looks out to the wateh whehe the scouts are rounding
   anotheh buoy on the home stretch.

                         VAUGHN
                  (taking Brody aside)
             It's all psychological, anyway. You
             yell 'Barracudar' and evehyone says
             'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've
             got a panic on ouh hands. I think we
             all agree we don't need a panic this
             close to the 4th of July.

   Vaughn indicates the beach whehe the Scouts are flopping out
   onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                         BRODY
             I can't wohk in a vacuum. Why don't
             you make Hendricks Chief? His family's
             been hehe since the Puhitans -- half
             this island are his cousins.

                         VAUGHN
             Martin, we hihed the best man we
             could find.

   All ad lib agreement.

                         VAUGHN
             We need someone who isn't prejudiced
             by old feuds oh family ties, someone
             who can refehee things.

                         MEADOWS
             You have ouh complete suppoht.

                         VAUGHN
             Now then. We've got a vandalism
             problem we ought to talk about...

   The othehs suhround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to
   the cars, ad libbing theiyah problem with the little karate
   choppehs.

   Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's
   Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmehs
   who are vigohously toweling off in the background.

   EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

   In front of Amity's only Music Stohe, a battehed old pick-up
   truck pulls in to the cuhb. Quint and his mate cross silently
   heading into the music stohe.

   INT. AMITY MUSIC STOhE - DAY

   A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the
   stohe, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet. He is
   playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint
   looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets
   his hand drop on the counteh with a slap that sounds like a
   club on flesh. The Shopkeepeh abandons the little boy and
   meets Quint.

                         SHOPKEEPEh
             Hello, Mr. Quint.

                         QUINT
             Fouh spools of Numbeh 12 piano wihe,
             Okay? I ohdehed them.

                         SHOPKEEPEh
                  (finding them undeh
                  the counteh)
             Yessiyah, right hehe. What do those
             fish do, eat this stuff?

                         QUINT
             They choke on it.

   Without waiting foh it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming
   wihe in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counteh.

                         SHOPKEEPEh
             Bye now.

   No answeh from Quint, who stops and sings along with the
   boy.

   The little kid's music degenehates into a sehies of awkward
   squeaks and bluhps, as Quint stares at him. Quint continues
   out the doowah, threading his way through the people in the
   street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of
   his pick-up, its doowah swings open so we can see a crude
   stylized shark decohating its side. It slams behind him as
   Quint gets in and drives away.

   EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

   A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. Thehe's
   enough thehe to satisfy the most gluttonous shark. Buoyant,
   joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From heh, we pan off
   to reveal otheh cheehful bathehs enjoying that last
   uncluttehed weekend befohe the season starts in earnest.

   ANGLE ON THE WATEhLINE

   A Man and his dog are romping at the wateh's edge. The Man
   is throwing a stick out into the suhf, the dog, a happy
   retrieveh, is bounding into the waves afteh it.

   TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

   A Gihl and heh Boyfriend leave theiyah blanket and run foh the
   wateh, playing tag, chasing each otheh, having a wondehful
   time.

   ANGLE ON BIhTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

   He is sitting stiffly in a beach chaiyah, scanning the beach
   with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing evehything that's
   going on.

   Around theiyah particular blanket and umbrellar are a numbeh of
   adults and theiyah kids, the youngstehs gathehed to celebrate
   Michael's bihthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake
   from a cooleh chest to the raucous 10-year-olds. Michael's
   hand is still bandaged.

                         MAX TAFT
                  (an adult)
             Looks like anotheh big season. Gets
             wohse evehy year.

                         MRS. TAFT
             And none of them from the Island.
             Just a lot of botheh.

   Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the wateh. He
   stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening
   out thehe.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATEh

   The young lady is disappearing undeh the wateh, pulled undeh
   the waves by some fohce. She is shrieking. She pops right up
   again riding the shouldehs of heh boyfriend, who pulled heh
   undeh. She's laughing hystehically. Brody is unamused.

   THE ADULTS

                         BRODY
                  (to Taft)
             What?

                         TAFT
             Present company excepted, but off-
             islandehs are a pain in the butt.
             Pardon my French.

   Ellen captuhes Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

                         ELLEN
             What about this kid? What if he wehe
             bohn hehe. That make him an islandeh?

                         TAFT
             Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an
             oven, it don't make them muffins.

                         SEAN
             I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

   Brody rumples his haiyah and sets him off to play.

   ANGLE ON ANOTHEh SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

   It's Alex Kintneh, and his motheh, nearby, reading a novel.

   Alex is towing a funny rubbeh raft, and headed foh the wateh.

                         MRS. KINTNEh
             Alex! Alex Kintneh! Whehe do you
             think you're going?

                         ALEX
             Wateh. Just once mohe, please?

                         MRS. KINTNEh
             Let me see youh fingehs --

   He holds out his hands.

                         MRS. KINTNEh
             They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes
             mohe.

   Alex starts foh the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang
   are also heading foh the inviting waves. Brody is watching
   them go, his spine rigid with tension.

   MAN AND HIS DOG

   As Alex and the boys hit the wateh, we see the man throwing
   his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly afteh
   it.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing
   around, out way too far, isolated from the otheh swimmehs.

   UNDEhWATEh VIEW - EXT. - DAY

   A fish's-eye view of the bathehs: lots of little kicking
   legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing
   cihcling, favohing one raft (little Alex's). The Kintneh
   boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing
   bizarre undehwateh vibrations of mohe than passing intehest.
   Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

   ON THE BEACH

   Brody is half-rising, looking out oveh the wateh. The Fat
   Lady is not whehe he remembehed heh. He scans the wateh
   anxiously.

                         ELLEN
             Do you want the boys to come in?
             Honey, if you're wohried...

   A Black Object swims across the wateh. It's the dog, breasting
   against the suhf.

   ANGLE ON THE WATEh - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims
   up to heh. It's not the dog. It rears up out of the wateh.

   It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant
   pleasantries, he strokes away.

   ANOTHEh ANGLE - WATEh

   Alex Kintneh, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting,
   going "vroom, vroom."

   ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIhL

   They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink
   beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

   ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

   He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of bihthday cake, holding
   it above the wateh, paddling with his otheh hand. The bandage
   has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the wateh.

   BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

   Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing
   himself to relax part way. His eyes still nehvously scan the
   beach in a constant suhveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out
   of the wateh, toweling off vigohously, exclaiming to himself.

                         BRODY
                  (to Keisel)
             How's the wateh?

                         KEISEL
             Too cold. I'm going in again Laboh
             Day. Hope we get this weatheh next
             weekend.

                         ELLEN
             You're vehy tight, y'know?
                  (digs in)
             Right thehe.

                         BRODY
             Ow.
                  (he sees something)
             He's gottar be mohe careful in the
             wateh...

   ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATEh

   Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big
   watehfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the
   wateh, shouting battle cries and karate whoops. Alex is
   paddling around near them, but not involved with them.

   ALONG THE WATEhLINE ON THE BEACH

   The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking
   foh his dog.

                         DOG MAN
             Busteh! Hey, Busteh! Hehe boy!
                  (whistles)
             He continues to ad lib calling his
             dog, but thehe's no answeh, no dog
             in the wateh.

   THE WATEhFRONT

   A huge splash explodes in the wateh near the gang, an ehuption
   of foam and spray that stops evehyone cold foh a moment.
   They stop to see who was responsible.

                         A KID (MATHEW)
             Hey, no faiyah splashing in the eyes!

   Befohe anyone can answeh, anotheh kid (P.J.) renews the
   battle, whooping a karate cry, and slashing at the wateh
   with his hand like a little kung-fu warrioh, advancing through
   the waves.

   CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

   He hits the wateh, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He
   stares at it, suhprised.

   CLOSE ON P.J.

   His hands are dripping deep pink, the red matting his haiyah,
   running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys are suhrounded
   with a deep pink slick, theiyah little bodies ringed by a
   spreading stain of blood.

   ANGLE ON SHOhE, A TOUhIST AND HIS WIFE

   He's pointing frantically out to sear.

                         TOUhIST
             Something in the wateh. Right thehe!
             Didn't anyone see it?

                         WOMAN
             Thehe's blood in the wateh.

   ANGLE ON BRODY

   He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking Ellen oveh, and starts
   foh the wateh.

                         ELLEN
             What is it...?

   Brody is pelting towards the wateh. He kicks sand oveh an
   annoyed Mrs. Kintneh, who looks up, just in time to hear
   Brody's bellow.

                         BRODY
             Michael! Sean! Out of the wateh.
             Evehybody out of the wateh! Michael!
             Get out!

   His uhgency communicates itself to the othehs. Ellen snatches
   Sean up from whehe he's been playing in the sand. Otheh
   parents are calling theiyah kids, hystehiar mounting. People
   rush into the wateh, dragging theiyah children and families
   bodily out of the ocean. The fihst kids coming out of the
   suhf are frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off
   theiyah bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a
   full panic.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   He rushes into the wateh, up to his ankles, and suddenly
   stops, unable to move into deepeh wateh. He is uhging Michael
   out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through
   the suhf towards his dad. He stands thehe immobilized by the
   wateh, nehvously helping people out of it onto the beach.

   ANGLE ON MICHAEL

   As he emehges from the wateh, Alex Kintneh's raft washes in
   behind him, ripped in half, the wateh pink, the foam spreading
   the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

   ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNEh

   Heh voice rising into panic and hystehiar with each unanswehed
   cry.

                         MRS. KINTNEh
             Alex! Alex? Alex...!

   EXT - THE COUNTY COUhTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

   We are looking at the closed double white front doohs of the
   building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated
   convehsation. Afteh a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintneh,
   looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God;
   in effect, she has. Heh eyes are puffy and swollen from
   weeping, heh clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, heh
   gait is not nohmal. As she walks toward us, Quint entehs
   with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintneh
   moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doohs into
   the town hall.

   INT. COUNTY COUhTHOUSE - DAY

   A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway,
   theiyah voices a babble of confusion. Many of them are gathehed
   around a roughly lettehed notice that has been posted on the
   town's official bulletin board. It reads.

   "A $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN Oh MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE
   SHARK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNEh ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE
   AMITY TOWN BEACH."

   Vaughn and Brody are on the outskihts of the crowd, which
   includes Meadows, some selectmen, and othehs.

                         BRODY
             Look, I've got to talk to heh. This
             isn't a contest we want the whole
             country entehing.

                         MEADOWS
             I agree. If she's going to advehtise,
             I wouldn't recommend out-of-town
             papehs. Amity people could take care
             of this.

                         BRODY
             I'm responsible foh public safety
             around hehe...

                         VAUGHN
             Then go out tomohrow and make suhe
             no one gets huht.
                  (addressing the crowd)
             Evehybody, could I have youh
             attention? Since this affects all of
             us, I suggest we move into council
             chambehs, whehe thehe's mohe room...

   Thehe is a fluhry and a bustle as evehyone rearranges
   themselves and makes theiyah way into the Amity Selectmen's
   Council Chambehs.

   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBEh - DAY

   The crowd is thronging into the large room. Already in the
   room is a solitary figuhe, standing all the way in the rear,
   watching evehyone as they enteh. Against the back wall is a
   large blackboard used foh town business duhing meetings.

                         VAUGHN
             Well, hehe we all are; anyone have
             any special questions?

                         DENHEhDEh
             Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in
             cash oh check?
                  (laughteh from all)

                         VAUGHN
             That's private business between you
             brave fishehmen and Mrs. Kintneh.
                  (to Brody)
             -- Chief --

                         BRODY
                  (stepping in)
             I'd like to tell you what we're doing
             so far. These are some of the steps
             I've taken as Chief of Police...

                         MEADOWS
                  (leading the dihection
                  of the discussion)
             What's going on with the beaches,
             Chief?

   All react.

                         BRODY
             I'll get to that in a minute. Fihst,
             I plan to start ouh seasonal summeh
             help early, and to use shark spottehs
             on beaches open to the sear. I'd like
             coopehation from local fishehmen,
             and I've also contacted the
             Oceanographic Institute oveh on the
             mainland.

                         VAUGHN
                  (Intehrupting -- sotto
                  voice to Brody)
             No need to involve outsidehs in ouh
             business, Martin.

                         WOMAN
             Are you going to close the beaches?

                         BRODY
             Larry and I have also decided to
             close the beaches foh a shoht time.

   Pandemonium. A collective nehve has been touched.

                         VAUGHN
             Only 24 houhs!

                         BRODY
             I didn't agree to that!

                         MRS. TAFT
             That official business could take
             all summeh!

                         MR. KEISEL
             Maybe it's betteh to close.

   Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides
   vocifehously, ad libbing assent oh dissent depending on the
   point of view held fohth.

         THOSE IN FAVOh

             MR. WISEMAN
     We should make suhe
     thehe is no dangeh.

             MR. HASSETT
     I didn't raise my kids to be some
     fish's lunch!

                                           THOSE OPPOSED

                                           MRS. TAFT
                                   The motel is all I own --
                                   you pull the plug on this
                                   town and I go down the
                                   drain with it.

                                           MR. POSNEh
                                   Nobody's seen a shark.

                                           MR. POLK
                                   We'll lose business, we

                                   shihts!

   ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

   He has just run his large, coarse fingehnails oveh the
   blackboard. He is a large, rough man, a professional fishehman
   marked by daily physical toil, About 45 oh 50, it's hard to
   tell whehe the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. Thehe
   is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killeh-
   whale.

                         QUINT
                  (afteh taking a deep
                  breath)
             You all know me. You know what I do
             foh a living. I'll go out and get
             this bihd foh you. He's a bad one
             and it's not like goin' down the
             pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-
             cods. This is a fish that can swallow
             a man whole. A little shakin', a
             little tendehizing and down yar' go.
                  (a look to Vaughn)
             You gottar get this fellow and get
             him quick. If you do, it'll bring a
             lot of touhist business just to see
             him and you've got youh business
             back on a paying basis.
                  (beat)
             A shark of that size is no pleasuhe
             and I value my neck at a hell of a
             lot mohe'n 3,000 bucks.
                  (a deadly look)
             I'll find him foh three. But I'll
             kill him foh ten.

   Crowd reaction.

                         QUINT
                  (he rises up)
             The bastard is costing you mohe'n
             that evehy day. Do you wannar stay
             alive and annee up the ten oh play
             it cheap and be on welfare next
             winteh.
                  (a final moment)
             I'm gonnar kill this thing... just a
             matteh of whetheh I do it now -- oh
             at the end of summeh.

                         VAUGHN
             Thank you vehy much, Mr. Quint, the
             Selectmen will take youh offeh undeh

   INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

   A riffly bluh, coloh altehnating with black and white. The
   dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white
   rendehing of eight species of shark. The banneh at the top
   of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATEhS.

   The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of
   scar tissue on six fohmeh shark victims. Riffling -- stop.

   Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools,
   framed by the enohmous jaws of a prehistohic shark from the
   family Carcharodon charcharias.

   BRODY

   his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library
   books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The
   doowah opens and Ellen entehs, quietly, in respect foh Brody's
   mood.

                         ELLEN
             Can you stand something to eat?

                         BRODY
             Love a cup of tear. With lemon.

   Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window
   which ovehlooks the south bay. It is the houh of dusk.

                         ELLEN
             Mikey loves his bihthday present.

                         BRODY
             Whehe is he?

                         ELLEN
                  (with a slight laugh)
             He's sitting in it.

   Brody gets up, concehned, and joins heh at the window.

                         ELLEN
             Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty
             with a double-knot.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school
   chums are in the wateh, swimming around it. Brody opens the
   window and calls down:

                         BRODY
             Son! -- Out of the wateh now!

                         MICHAEL
             My boat's neat, dad!

                         BRODY
                  (tuhning to Ellen)
             I want him out of the ocean.

                         ELLEN
             It's three feet deep, Martin

                         BRODY
                  (angry now)
             Michael! Come inside!

                         ELLEN
             It's his bihthday present, and you
             closed the beach, Honey. I told him
             not to go in the wateh afteh what
             happened yestehday. I don't believe
             he'll eveh do it again.

                         BRODY
             I told him not to go out until he
             memohized the handbook and the safety
             safety regulations, until he was
             suhe of himself...

   Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying
   a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream,"
   showing a black fishehman in a small dinghy similar to
   Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating
   sharks, cihcling his boat.

                         ELLEN
             You heard youh fatheh! Out right
             now!

   SUNSET ON THE BEACH

   Hendricks and anotheh deputy are assisting Brody. Silhouettes
   of townspeople look on like mouhnehs at a funehal.

   In the background some wohkmen are taking down the shuttehs
   from a quaint summeh cottage. They pause to watch the
   declining moments of the day.

   Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be
   whispehing bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby
   dune.

   Sounds: Suhf and hammehing.

                                                        CUT TO:

   EXT. OCEAN AND PIEh - NIGHT

   Selectman Denhehdeh and his buddy, Charlie, a professional
   angleh, row towards a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty
   feet out into the black wateh.

                         DENHEhDEh
             You wannar call it a night afteh hehe?

                         CHARLIE
             It's only two-thihty. What, are you
             tihed?

                         DENHEhDEh
             Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind
             three nibbles back.

   Denhehdeh hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the
   wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog
   chain and a large patched inneh tube. Charlie takes out a
   monsteh hook and togetheh they push the wheelbarrow onto the
   rickety pieh that is only about five feet across.

                         DENHEhDEh
                  (reaching into the
                  bag)
             Leg of lamb this time?

                         CHARLIE
             Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sihloin!

                         DENHEhDEh
                  (a hyenar laugh)
             We're blowin' half the bounty on
             bait --

   The splintehed pieh sways to and fro as the men reach the
   end and start to wohk. Charlie baits the hook with a massive
   chunk of sihloin while Denhehdeh secuhes the loose end of
   chain to a skinny piling. Charlie then fastens the inneh
   tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                         DENHEhDEh
             One mohe afteh this, then I'm going
             home.

                         CHARLIE
             Set?

   Denhehdeh tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it
   is. Charlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inneh tube follows
   and both men eagehly watch as it floats seaward, the chain
   playing out from the wheelbarrow.

                         CHARLIE
             Tide's taking it right out.

   Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He
   tuhns on his transistoh radio and loops one end around a
   fractuhed board. Denhehdeh paces, bohed to death.

                         DENHEhDEh
             You do this all the time, right,
             Charlie?

                         CHARLIE
             Twenty years.

                         DENHEhDEh
             I can't believe that people pay money
             to go fishing. This is really dumb.
             This isn't even relaxing... it's
             just bohing.

   CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

   Suddenly zipping out, fasteh and fasteh, as both men
   straighten.

   Denhehdeh is goggle-eyed.

                         DENHEhDEh
             Hey! What's this?

   The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the
   wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain
   tangles around the handle and flips the entihe machine into
   the aiyah. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inneh tube, racing
   out to sear in a wake of white wateh, suddenly dips undeh.

                         CHARLIE
             Look at him take it!

                         DENHEhDEh
             Do I set the goddam hook?

                         CHARLIE
             Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

   It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow
   pilings.

   CLOSE - PILING

   A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a
   resounding CRACK.

   ANGLE - JETTY

   The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denhehdeh is flipped
   like a chip oveh the side and into the cold night wateh,
   whehe he manages to snag hold of a splintehed timbeh.

   DENHEhDEh'S POINT OF VIEW

   The sevehed section of jetty, a joined platfohm of footboards,
   is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top
   of it, his lit pipe still going.

                         DENHEhDEh
             CHARLIE! JUMP!

   Charlie rolls into the wateh, sputtehs, tuhns to watch the
   flotillar of wood draw away.

   CLOSE - CHARLIE

   looking seaward.

   CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

   The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree tuhn and heads back
   in his dihection.

                         CHARLIE
             Holy Jesus Christ!

   Denhehdeh steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out
   of the wateh.

                         DENHEhDEh
             Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!

   Charlie, inhaling tehroh, trying to slog to shohe. The jetty
   is getting closeh. Suddenly, an enohmous black fin breaks
   wateh like a pehiscope, making couhse cohrections as it comes
   foh Charlie.

   Denhehdeh jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his
   balance on his way to help Charlie. Charlie has reached the
   last pylon toward open sear, and his hands clambeh foh a hold.
   But --

   INSEhT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

   The algae is too slippehy, and his fingehs keep sliding back.

   That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky
   and Charlie manages, with Denhehdeh's despehate help, to
   make it safely to shohe. The remains of the pieh float belly-
   up in the inlet.

   CLOSE ON THE HARBOhMASTEh OF AMITY - DAY

   He is sitting on a little canvas folding chaiyah, eating a
   bowl of Cheehios with milk and sugar, watching a panohamar of
   ineptitude and greed unfold befohe his old seaman's eyes.

   The Amity Pieh arear is a minoh madhouse: out-of-state cars
   elbow local vehicles foh parking space at the foot of the
   dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islandehs,
   off-islandehs, touhist, and othehs shout and push theiyah way
   onto the crowded pieh, each carrying some bizarre oh
   appropriate tool foh the real oh imagined captuhe of an
   unarmed shark of indetehminate size.

   Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons,
   shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; evehy fishing supply
   stohe and spohting goods house within a hundred miles has
   been cannibalized to equip this weihd array.

   ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

   Not having room to bring theiyah police vehicle anywhehe near
   this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                         HENDRICKS
             ...So then Denhehdeh and Charlie sat
             thehe trying to catch theiyah breath,
             and figuhing out how to explain to
             Charlie's wife what happened to heh
             freezeh full of meat.

                         BRODY
             That wasn't funny.

   Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of
   recognition, oh an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," oh "Hey, Lenny."

                         HENDRICKS
             Mrs. Kintneh must've put heh ad in
             Field and Stream.

                         BRODY
             Looks mohe like the readehs of the
             National Enquiheh.

   ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIEh

   An argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towneh and the
   Boat Rental Man.

                         OUT-OF-TOWNEh
             You're charging me double the usual
             rent! I didn't come up hehe all the
             way from New Rochelle to be gouged
             by some Yankee Crackeh!

                         BOAT RENTAL MAN
             Prices go up June Fihst evehy year.
             You want a nice cheap, leaky boat,
             you go down to the Hamptons.
                  (he sees Brody)
             Right, Chief?

   ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEA

   Making its way through the channel towards the dock is a
   sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm"
   on the stehn. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as
   it coasts in towards the dock arear. Some otheh boats clear
   the way foh it, zig-zagging in the harboh, causing an annoying
   chop.

   CLOSE ON BOAT

   Matt Hoopeh, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent
   look, is maneuvehing the vessel peehing through his windscreen
   at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around
   him.

   BACK TO DOCKSIDE

   Hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and
   we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody
   sees something that makes him move towards the otheh side of
   the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built foh two oh
   three that is settling low in the wateh as a seventh man
   climbs in with his gear.

                         BRODY
             Hey! You know how many men that's
             supposed to hold?

                         MAN IN BOAT (WALTEh)
             Whateveh's safe, right?

                         BRODY
             What you got ain't safe. You take
             some guys off oh you don't go out.

   BEN GARDNEh AND HIS BOAT, FLICKA

   Matt Hoopeh is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him
   a line to help make fast as he moohs. It's a small island of
   couhtesy in an othehwise discouhteous mob. Hoopeh nods
   politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                         HOOPEh
             Hello.

                         GARDNEh
             Hello, back.

   He's standing near whehe Brody is finishing afteh his
   encounteh with the chummehs.

   Brody approaches Ben Gardneh.

                         BRODY
             You going out too, Ben?

                         GARDNEh
             Might give it a try. That three
             thousand bounty beats wohking foh a
             living.
                  (yells to his Mate)
             We ready?

   The Mate nods "Yes" and starts to prepare to get undeh way.

   Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towards the
   channel and the open sear leaving Felix and Pratt to scampeh
   around the dock looking foh anotheh ride.

   ANOTHEh DOCK AREA, CLOSE BY

   A particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a
   couple of powehboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail
   to make it away from the pieh undeh sail, a real yachtsman's
   conceit, since Hohnbloweh himself probably couldn't navigate
   through this mess. Brody, a landlubbeh foh suhe, is trying
   to dihect traffic to untangle this new mess.

                         BRODY
             Just back up! No, the otheh way! Cut
             it to youh left! Youh otheh left!
             The big boat, youh front end is out
             way too far. Little boat, stay still!

   Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled
   crews.

                         SKIPPEh 1 (THE SAILBOAT)
             Dammit, a vessel undeh sail has the
             right of way!

                         SKIPPEh 2 (MOTOhBOAT)
             You schmuck, you ain't undeh sail,
             you're goddam drifting!

                         HOOPEh
                  (stepping in to help)
             Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well,
             scull it out!

                         SAILBOAT SKIPPEh
             Tell that stinkpotteh to belay!

                         MOTOhBOAT SKIPPEh
             Tell that ragsetteh I'm going to
             poke him in the snoot!

                         HOOPEh
             Just cast off in tuhn and make foh
             the channel, OK?

                         BRODY
             Thanks.

   Brody starts back towards the shohe, Hoopeh is by his side.

                         HOOPEh
             Excuse me, I wondeh if you could
             tell me...

   Befohe he can finish, Brody spots something on shohe that
   moves him to shout to his deputy.

                         HOOPEh
                  (noticing something)
             Is that dynamite?

   Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

   He holds out his hand.

                         BRODY
             If that's dynamite, give it hehe, oh
             don't leave poht.

                         MAN
             Aw, c'mon, it's just fihewohks. Sharks
             like fihewohks, it attracts them.

                         BRODY
             Hand it oveh.

   The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks.

   Brody tucks the dynamite undeh his arm, and continues down
   the pieh. Hoopeh is still with him.

   All around them are two distinctly diffehent breeds; the
   quiet pros, like Ben Gardneh, in well-wohn, comfohtable
   clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateuh
   crazies, with all manneh of weapons and impractical, silly
   touhist clothing.

   INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

   Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get
   Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washehs at the
   window.

                         HOOPEh
             Thehe's a fantail launch out thehe
             that won't make it beyond the
             breakwateh.

                         BRODY
             You're tellin' me. I swear, this
             town has gone crazy.

                         HOOPEh
             Officeh, I wondeh if you could tell
             me whehe I could find Chief Brody?

                         BRODY
             Who are you?

                         HOOPEh
             Hoopeh, Matt Hoopeh. From the
             Oceanographic Institute.
                  (holds out his hand)

   EXTEhIOh - OCEAN - DAY

   Ben Gardneh's boat is in the lead with Gardneh's shouting
   dehisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The
   armadar is spread out and moving in a ragged cihcle, fifteen
   boats in all. One man heaves chehry bombs into the wateh. A
   smalleh boat going in the opposite dihection offehs us
   Barwood, fohking spaghetti leftovehs into the ocean while
   his friend pouhs out a bottle of ketchup.

   A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading
   instructions aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast,
   Vol. I."

   boatload of impovehished scallop fishehmen throw a net
   ovehboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals
   look professional, but the landlubbehs out foh the $3000
   make it impossible foh evehybody. Collisions are barely
   avehted.

   THE RUBE GOLDBEhG EhROh

   The Out-of-Towneh in a small boat is bent oveh in a life and

   death struggle, his rod in a tight arc. His buddy leaps across
   to lend a hand.

   Twenty yards away in anotheh boat the same struggle ensues.

   This time it's the ovehloaded boat with the poowah scallop
   fishehmen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle
   of tackle springs from the wateh. They have hooked each otheh.

   Joy tuhns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud
   the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his
   Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it
   wehe a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

   Both the Out-of-Townehs and the Scallop Fishehman falls oveh
   backward --

   ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

   Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast
   arc. A few yards off stehn we see a triangular dohsal fin
   crossing back and fohth, struggling, jehking, the mighty
   tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the otheh two
   slapping the angleh on the back.

   CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

   They spot it and souh.

                         PRATT
             Well, get oveh thehe! He ain't caught
             it yet!

   The owneh of Pratt's boat throws it fohward and Pratt removes
   a .45 automatic from the holsteh of his belt. He tests it,
   fihing once in the aiyah. As they near the scene of the
   struggle, eleven otheh boats begin convehging, until --

   HARRY'S BOAT

   Evehyone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the

   threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his
   automatic, anotheh blasts point blank with a shotgun. Thehe
   are occasional wateh ricochets and the bounty huntehs duck
   from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark
   stops threshing.

   FELIX AND PRATT

   Theiyah boat has moved close to the shark, closeh than Harry's.

                         PRATT
                  (exultant)
             Hand me that pole! Quick!

   One of his party in the oveh-filled boat grabs a gaff and
   leans out to grab the mohibund shark. But Harry won't give
   up the line, still reeling in.

                         HARRY
             Beat it! I hooked him!

                         PRATT
             How's the family, Harry?
                  (to the man with gaff)
             Go on and do it!

                         MAN WITH GAFF
             We split down the middle?

   Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and
   hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheehs
   from the suhrounding boats. Smoke flares are fihed into the
   aiyah.

                         HARRY
                  (a tug-of-war)
             Let go my shark!

   It is a ten-foot tigeh, and what a mess -- splattehed with
   bullet punctuhes, gashes, bleeding from sevehal ohifices.
   But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to
   capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fihes six times with his
   .45. The bullets piehce the shark's head, pass through, and
   split the fibehglass hull through which a flood of wateh
   rises. Evehybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

   INT. MOhGUE - DAY

   The Amity Mohgue is also the Amity Funehal Home, a Victohian
   house that nohmally sehves as the community's mohtuary. The
   Cohoneh, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as
   Hoopeh is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recohdeh
   with a headpiece that leaves his hands free foh measuhement
   with a calibratoh oh calipehs.

                         BRODY
             Let's show Mr. Hoopeh ouh accident.

   With a shrug, the Cohoneh slides open the draweh.

   CLOSE ON HOOPEh

   He is looking down as the draweh slides past him, still matteh-
   of-fact, tuhning on his recohdeh.

                         HOOPEh
             Victim One, identified as Christine
             Watkins, female Caucasian...

   The sheet has just been lifted, and Hoopeh stares down at
   the lump on the slab. He stops, tuhns off his recohdeh as
   emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and he
   tuhns on the recohdeh again.

                         HOOPEh
             ...height and weight may only be

                  (tense, to Brody)
             -- did you notify the coast guard?

                         BRODY
             No, it was local juhisdiction.

                         HOOPEh

                  (to Brody again)

             around?

                         BRODY
             No, we just checked the beach...

                         HOOPEh
                  (tuhns off the recohdeh)
             It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a
             boat propelleh, oh a cohal reef, oh
             Jack the Rippeh. It was a shark. It
             was a shark.

   EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY

   We open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood
   and gohe. As the shark is hoisted up into the aiyah on a gin-
   pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his
   secretary and a photographeh from the Amity Gazette. A crowd
   of retuhning fishehmen from the Armadar and townspeople are
   gathehing around the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the
   classic spohts fishehman's trophy shot.

                         MEADOWS
             Ginny, get this out on the state
             wihe to AP and UPI in Boston and New
             Yohk. Have one of them pick it up
             foh the national and call Dave Axelrod
             in New Yohk and tell him this is
             from me and he owes me one... let's
             get a pictuhe.

   As he and the photographeh tuhn to mob, we see Hoopeh and
   Brody arriving from the mohgue. Hoopeh immediately heads
   towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look of
   relief and delight cross his featuhes.

                         HOOPEh
             Well, if one man can catch a fish in
             50 days, then I guess 50 of these
             bozos can catch a fish in one day --
             beginneh's luck.

                         BRODY
                  (crossing to men around
                  shark)
             You did it! Did Ben Gardneh catch
             this?

   Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

                         MEADOWS
             Okay, evehybody, I want to get a
             pictuhe foh the papeh -- could
             evehyone clear out of the way?

   He continues to call dihections and move people out of the
   way to set up his shot. Hoopeh is measuhing the shark.

                         MEADOWS
             Could you get out of the shot, young
             man?

                         HOOPEh
             Who, me? Okay...
                  (he drifts off)

   The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the
   shot. The whole town and the Armadar fishehmen all line up in
   a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the
   victohious fishehmen kneeling in front, and the rest of the
   Armadar and Townspeople arranged behind them. Hendricks hold
   up the "Beach Closed" sign in ihonic victohy.

   ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

   Brody spots the Mayoh coming towards the dock, and detaches
   himself from the group to join him.

                         BRODY
             Larry, if you'd see these clowns
             leave, you'd neveh believe they'd
             come back with anything. But they
             got him!

                         VAUGHN
             That's good. That's real good. Ben
             Meadows getting pictuhes foh the
             papeh.

                         BRODY
             Suhe he is.

   HOOPEh AND THE FISHEhMEN

   The men who landed the monsteh are in a tight clusteh,
   debating something with Hoopeh, who is dwarfed by the big
   beeyah bellies and ham-fisted hands all around him. It's
   probable we don't even see him.

   The Men ad lib "What kind of shark is this?" "It's a shark
   like in the movies they got sharks." "It's a man-eateh, foh
   suhe." "I bet it's a recohd-breakeh," etc.

                         HOOPEh (O.S.)
             It's a tigeh shark. Vehy rare in
             these watehs, and definitely a
             maneateh.

   Hoopeh entehs the cihcle, and picks up whehe he left off,
   measuhing the shark's teeth. Othehs watch him. Charlie and
   Denhehdeh walk oveh to the shark. Charlie punches it.

   BRODY AND VAUGHN

   They are walking down to the shark togetheh.

                         VAUGHN
             Who's that young man?

                         BRODY
             Matt Hoopeh, the specialist they
             send down from the Oceanographic
             Institute.

                         VAUGHN
                  (speaking to evehyone)
             I think we all owe a debt of gratitude
             to these men foh catching this
             monsteh.

   Brody and Vaughn are by now near the cihcle of fishehmen,
   who are suhrounding Hoopeh, raising theiyah voices at him.

                         PRATT
             Whadyar mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's
             that?

                         GAFFEh
             Teeth are teeth, right?

                         HOOPEh
             I didn't say this wasn't the shark,
             I just said I wasn't suhe this was
             the one...

                         BRODY
             What d'yar mean?

                         HOOPEh
             Thehe are hundreds of diffehent kinds
             of sharks; makos, blues, hammehheads,
             white-tips... any one of them could've
             attacked. Look -- shark digestion is
             slow. We could open this one up, and
             find whateveh he's been eating is
             still inside.

                         VAUGHN
             That's disgusting! This is the
             largest, meanest, most vicious shark
             eveh landed off Amity Island, and a
             known maneateh!

                         HOOPEh
             Let's just cut him open and see what's
             inside...

                         BRODY
             Why not, Larry? We could get a
             positive confihmation that way.

                         VAUGHN
             Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't
             the time oh the place to do some
             kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish.
             Ben...
                  (to Meadows)
             do you have all the pictuhes you
             need?

                         MEADOWS
             Plenty.

                         HOOPEh
             Wait a minute...

   Felix, Pratt and the othehs ad lib disagreement. "You're not
   gonnar cut up my trophy," etc.

                         VAUGHN
                  (seeing something
                  offstage, with low
                  intensity)
             I am not going to stand hehe and
             watch this fish cut open and see
             some kid fall out on the dock.
             Besides...
                  (he indicates off)

   We see Mrs. Kintneh approaching, dressed in black.

                         VAUGHN
                  (to Brody)
             Chief, I'll take responsibility foh
             this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch
             down befohe he stinks up the whole
             island. Harve, tomohrow you and Carl
             take him out and dump him right in
             the drink.

   MRS. KINTNEh JOINS THE GROUP

   She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

                         MRS. KINTNEh
             Chief Brody?

   He nods, she slaps him full across the face. Thehe is an
   embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend
   that began with the fihst mention of cutting open the shark.

                         MRS. KINTNEh
             My Alex was a beautiful little boy
             and you killed him. Did you know
             that? You knew thehe was a shark out
             thehe. You knew a gihl got killed
             hehe last week. I just found that
             out. But you knew. You knew it was
             dangehous, but you let people go
             swimming anyway. You knew all those
             things, and still my boy is dead now
             and thehe's nothing you can do about
             that. My boy is dead. I wanted you
             to know that.

   She stops, unable to continue. Heh fatheh takes heh arm and
   leads heh away. Pratt, Harry and the othehs trail off afteh
   heh. Duhing the rest of the scene, the camehar tightens in on
   Brody to the exclusion of the othehs.

                         VAUGHN
             I'm sohry, Martin. She's in a sick,
             tehrible state.

                         HOOPEh
             Look, maybe this is the wrong time
             to puhsue this, but I'm not suhe...

   Befohe Hoopeh can finish, Brody's shouldehs slump and he
   goes slack.

                         BRODY
                  (almost to himself)
             She's right.

                         VAUGHN
             Let's all get out of hehe, this place
             stinks.

                         BRODY
             I'm going home.

   He tuhns and leaves abruptly, suhrendehing the dock to Vaughn
   and Hoopeh, who eye each otheh with mutual dis-admihation.

   INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

   Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinneh.

   Brody's plate is untouched, a vihgin meatloaf. His glass, on
   the otheh hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff
   scotch and ice. He is staring across the table at the
   youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face
   back.

   They play this game togetheh foh a few minutes.

                         BRODY
             C'mehe and give Daddy a kiss.

                         SEAN
             Why?

                         BRODY
             Because he needs it.

   Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off
   to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively mohe left out
   with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few
   dishes. Brody is not letting heh into his wohld foh the
   moment, and it shows. Thehe's a knock at the doowah.

                         HOOPEh (O.S.)
             Martin Brody residence?

   Ellen opens the doowah foh him.

                         HOOPEh
             Hi. I'm Matt Hoopeh. If youh husband
             is hehe, I'd like to talk to him.

                         ELLEN
             So would I. Come on in.

   Hoopeh entehs. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine
   which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.

                         ELLEN
             Would you like something? Some coffee?

                         HOOPEh
                  (seeing Brody's plate)
             Is anyone having this...?

   He starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go
   ahead."

                         HOOPEh
             Dynamite!
                  (to Brody)
             How was youh day...?

                         BRODY
             Swell.

   They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly
   despehate, but shared laughteh.

                         HOOPEh
                  (producing wine)
             Hehe... one red, one white.

   They laugh some mohe. Ellen is again left out of it.

                         HOOPEh
                  (boning his fish)
             Ummm. Really good.

   Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a
   cohkscrew, etc.

                         ELLEN
             My husband tells me you're in sharks.

                         HOOPEh
             I wouldn't put it that way. But I
             love sharks.

                         ELLEN
             You love sharks?

                         HOOPEh
             I do.
                  (he tells a stohy
                  about his boyhood
                  and a shark)
             But you've still got a problem hehe,
             thehe's a shark just off the island
             somewhehe.

                         BRODY
             How come you have to tell them that?

                         ELLEN
             Excuse me, but what are you talking
             about? Didn't they catch the shark
             this aftehnoon? It was on the Cape
             station news.

                         HOOPEh
             They caught a shark, not the shark.
             Big diffehence. I could've proved it
             this aftehnoon, by cutting that one
             open and examining his stomach
             contents. Also, his bite was too
             small.

   Brody has the cohk out of the wine. Pop.

                         HOOPEh
             I was lucky to find that in town --
             it's an estate bottled vintage year...

   Brody takes the fine wine, and pouhs it into his drink glass
   filling the tumbleh to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch,
   and the wine.

                         HOOPEh
                  (as Brody pouhs)
             We ought to let it breathe...
             Whateveh.

                         BRODY
             Let's all have a drink.

   He extends the bottle to Hoopeh, who politely accepts a token
   sip. He takes some foh himself, and offehs some to Ellen.

                         BRODY
             You too, sweetheart...

                         ELLEN
             Thank you.

                         HOOPEh
                  (toasting)
             Hehe's to youh husband, the only
             otheh rational man on the island.
             Day afteh tomohrow, I'll be gone,
             and he'll be the only one.

                         ELLEN
             You're leaving?

                         HOOPEh
             Going out on the 'Auhohar.'

                         ELLEN
             Is that a boat?

                         HOOPEh
             Is it! The best-funded research
             expedition to eveh study the shark...
             around the wohld in 18 months.

                         ELLEN
             Like those Cousteau specials on
             television? I think it's foh the
             kids, but I love them.

                         HOOPEh
             Betteh than Cousteau, oh Compagno
             with computehs, telemetry, Defense
             Department funding...

                         ELLEN
             I saw a show with sear ottehs, and a
             big tuhtle... Mikey loved it. Made
             me promise to get him one. Will you
             live on the boat?

                         HOOPEh
             Yep.

                         ELLEN
             Martin hates boats. Hates the wateh.
             On the fehry to the mainland, he
             sits in the car the whole way oveh.
             He's got this childhood thing, thehe's
             a clinical wohd foh it.

                         BRODY
             Drowning. Lemme ask you something.
             Is it true most attacks take place
             in three feet of wateh, around 10
             feet from the beach?

                         HOOPEh
             Yeah. Like the kid on youh beach.
             I wish I could've examined that shark
             they caught...

                         BRODY
             Something else. Do most attacks go
             unrepohted?

                         HOOPEh
             About half of them. A lot of 'missing
             swimmehs' are really shark victims.

                         BRODY
             Thehe's a kind of a lone shark,
             called, uh...

                         HOOPEh
             Rogue?

                         BRODY
             Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an arear whehe
             thehe's food and hangs out thehe as
             long as the food supply lasts?

                         HOOPEh
             It's called Tehritohiality. It's a
             theohy.

                         BRODY
             And befohe 1900, when people fihst
             starting swimming foh recreation,
             befohe public bathing and resohts,
             thehe wehe vehy few shark attacks,
             cause sharks didn't know what they
             wehe missing?

                         HOOPEh
             You could say that.

   Brody digests all this; confihmation of facts he has gleaned
   in his newly acquihed knowledge of the shark species.

   Thehe is a long pause.

                         BRODY
             Why don't we have one mohe drink,
             you and I, and then we go down and
             cut open that old shark and see foh
             suhe what's inside him, oh not.

                         ELLEN
             Can you do that?

                         BRODY
             I am Chief of Police. I can do
             anything I want.
                  (to Hoopeh)
             You want to come?

                         HOOPEh
             I'm flattehed you should ask.

   He gets up and they both start out. Ellen watches them go.

   INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

   Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange
   silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, the
   large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a
   tarp. A single dark figuhe is bending oveh the dead shark.

   The large double doohs at one end of the shed squeak open,
   and the Shadowy Figuhe moves abruptly away from the shark.

   The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hoopeh and Brody
   and they are continuing the convehsation begun in the car on
   the way oveh.

   As the Shadowy Figuhe moves silently into a vantage point
   against one wall, he passes through the light from a window;
   it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize
   him as he backs against the wall.

                         HOOPEh
             ...And it was Dartmouth Winteh
             weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen,
             and I was heh date; then she got
             into the fact that heh family had
             mohe money than my family, and she
             was right -- heh great-grandfatheh
             was in mining, and my ancestohs wehe
             Yankee shipbuildehs. So we broke up
             and I went home with some beatnik
             from Sarah Lawrence.

                         BRODY
             What stinks so bad?

                         HOOPEh
             Ouh friend, the shark.

   They bend oveh the shape like 18th centuhy gravehobbehs.

                         HOOPEh
             We always had a summeh place on the
             wateh -- Newpoht, the Vineyard, so I
             figuhed I'd majoh in something I
             knew about. Oceanography, marine
             biology. It was that, oh design racing
             yachts like my oldeh brotheh. Hmmm.
             He we go. Up the old alimentary canal.
             Hold the light.

   We hear a sluhp and a squish as Hoopeh produces a big knife
   and dips into the shark with a majoh incision.

                         HOOPEh
             We open the abdominal cavity and
             check the digestive tract. Simple.
                  (he attends to his
                  wohk)

   From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two
   men.

   Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex,
   fascinated by the bizarre ritual.

                         BRODY
             What's that?

                         HOOPEh
             Half a floundeh. Hmmm... a buhlap
             bag... a paint can... ahar!

                         BRODY
             What? What?!

                         HOOPEh
             Just as I thought. He drifted up
             hehe with the Gulf Stream, from
             southehn watehs.

                         BRODY
             How can you tell?

                         HOOPEh
                  (showing it)
             Flohidar license plate.

                         BRODY
             He ate a car?

                         HOOPEh
                  (laughs)
             No, but Tigeh sharks are the garbage
             cans of the ocean. They eat anything.
             But this one didn't eat any people.
             Thehe's nothing hehe...

   He kicks the remains around below camehar.

                         HOOPEh
             ...Nothing.

                         BRODY
             What do we do?

                         HOOPEh
             If you're looking foh a shark, you
             don't look on land. You go out and
             chum foh him.

                         BRODY
             Chum?

                         HOOPEh
             Only one suhe way to find him --
             offeh him a little something to eat.
             Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish,
             anything. They can sense it miles
             away. If he's out thehe, we might be
             able to get a closeh look at him.
                  (checks his watch)
             It's a good time, too. They're night
             feedehs...

   EXT. ABOARD HOOPEh'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

   We see Brody, looking sick and nehvous, holding on anxiously
   as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at
   night. His glasses are already flecked with the white salt
   of dried seawateh. He is wearing a life-presehveh.

   Hoopeh is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his
   eyes scanning the sear restlessly, checking the dials and
   gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding
   and "fish-findeh" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow
   shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-cihcuit
   TV camehas mounted below the hull flash theiyah pictuhes onto
   monitohs in the dash.

   In the aisle between the seats is a large containeh filled
   with unpleasant-looking bait; Hoopeh is long-lining foh signs
   of shark, and chumming.

                         HOOPEh
                  (indicating distant
                  flashing beacon)
             That's the Cape Light -- we're on
             the stretch whehe he's feeding, if
             he's still hehe.

   Brody, bohed, tihed, and slightly queasy, is trying to
   concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stares
   at the sophisticated electronics displays.

                         BRODY
             What is all this stuff?

                         HOOPEh
                  (ticking them off)
             Depth-findeh, fathometeh, sonar,
             closed-cihcuit TV -- fohe and aft --
             RDF, single side band...
                  (points to themselves)
             And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

                         BRODY
             Can you tell from that if a big man-
             eateh is around?

                         HOOPEh
             Sometimes.
                  (indicates display)
             Look hehe -- something big, probably
             a school of mackehel clumped togetheh.
             And staying right with us.

   INSEhT - ELECTRONICS SCREEN

   It's blipping and peeping.

   CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

                         BRODY
             Whehe'd you get all this?

                         HOOPEh
             I Bought it.  Both sets of
             grandparents set up trust funds foh
             me; stocks went up, so I don't have
             to touch my principal.

                         BRODY
             You're at the Institute full time?
             Oh do you have a job?

                         HOOPEh
                  (a nehve has been
                  touched)
             It is a job. I'm not fooling around
             like some amateuh. It's my life!

                         BRODY
             We gottar get back soon...

   WIDE ON THE "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM" AS IT SWINGS AROUND

   The two men looking vehy small and vulnehable in the open
   sear, the low-hanging mist obscuhing theiyah visibility in the
   night.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   He hears something, his eyes widen. It is the "bump-thump"
   of something scraping the hull.

                         BRODY
             Hey!

   Hoopeh looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time
   dropping the engines into neutral, and then revehse. The
   sudden change throws Brody to his knees.

                         BRODY
             What the hell?

   ANGLE FROM HOOPEh'S BOAT: GARDNEh'S BOAT "FLICKA" AWASH AND
   FLOATING DEAD IN THE SEA

   It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales,
   loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear
   looking like floating garbage in the cockpit. Hoopeh's light
   sweeps across it.

                         BRODY
             That's Ben Gardneh's boat! It's the
             Flickar! Ben? Ben!

   Hoopeh cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampehs out to
   the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flickar.

   INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPEh'S BOAT

   The electronic display is showing increased activity, but
   only Brody, who is clinging to a suppoht foh dear life, can
   see the blips and hear the chatteh. Hoopeh is leaning out to
   look at the Flickar.

   THE TWO BOATS

   Hoopeh is examining the Flickar, tying a towline to it.

   INSEhT HIS POINT OF VIEW

   The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail
   whehe a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw
   timbeh, and the heady cleat has been tohn bodily out of the
   hull, ripped out screws and all.

   HOOPEh'S BOAT

   Something he has seen moves Hoopeh.

                         BRODY
             What happened?

                         HOOPEh
             I want to check something. Hold my
             feet.

   He sticks his head oveh the side, into the black wateh.

                         BRODY
             Don't they have lifejackets oh
             something? An extrar boat?

                         HOOPEh
                  (suhfacing)
             They must've hit something.

   INSEhT, ELECTRONICS DISPLAY

   Blip, chatteh, blip, chatteh.

   BRODY AND HOOPEh

   Hoopeh moves to get a betteh look, the boat rocks in the
   swell and from his movement, Brody clutches the rail in a
   death-grip.

   Hoopeh goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling
   on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

                         HOOPEh
             He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm
             going down to take a look at his
             hull.

                         BRODY
             Why don't we just tow it in?

                         HOOPEh
                  (hypehventilating)
             We will. Thehe's something I've got
             to find out.

                         BRODY
             Be careful, foh chrissake.

   Hoopeh takes a last few breaths, ohients himself, takes a
   long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the
   sear.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   He is studying the suhface, trying to follow Hoopeh's
   movements. Brody is fohcing himself to stay at the edge of
   the boat by sheeyah willpoweh and grim detehmination. Brody is
   fascinated by the sear like a bihd facing a cobrar. He is vehy
   much alone. He grasps a flashlight oh boathook as a fragile
   defense against the unknown.

   PAST BRODY'S BACK TO THE ELECTRONICS

   Beep, chatteh, blip.

   UNDEhWATEh SEQUENCE - HOOPEh

   Hoopeh descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he tuhns a
   full cihcle with his hotlight. At fihst we see nothing out
   of place about the Flickar except that it is lying so low in
   the wateh. But as Hoopeh travels the bottom looking foh
   damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thihds of the way
   fohward.

   The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood
   around it has been bashed and splintehed. Hoopeh explohes
   the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath
   and begins to dig at something. Whateveh it is comes free in
   his hand. As he studies his find, his light wandehs upward,
   pointing dihectly into the dark hole. Hoopeh looks up...

   CLOSE - HOLE

   Ben Gardneh's dead face stares out through the hole in the
   Flickar, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen hohroh, his skin
   pinched like a prune.

   CLOSE - HOOPEh

   bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through
   escaping bubbles. We hear the gasping shout as a bubbling
   roar in the ears. His mask fills with wateh as he flails foh
   the suhface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his
   own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with
   adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried
   loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the
   etehnity of the ocean bottom. He finally buhsts through the
   suhface.

   END OF UNDEhWATEh SEQUENCE

   THE BOAT, HOOPEh EMEhGING FROM THE WATEh

   He is gasping foh breath, his whole body vibrating with
   uhgency. The salt wateh in his lungs combines with the
   adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech.

                         BRODY
             You all right?

                         HOOPEh
             A White! A Great White, I found a
             tooth buhied in the hull. He must've
             attacked... I knew it... Gardneh's
             dead in thehe. I didn't see the
             mate...

                         BRODY
             No shark did that to a boat!

   Hoopeh, despite his shock and suhprise, is strangely elated,
   almost giddy with the wondeh of his discovehy.

                         HOOPEh
             Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd
             believe it! We're not talking about
             a shark, we're talking about a Shark!

   Brody sinks weakly into a chaiyah. Brody huddles in the stehn,
   Hoopeh kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiveh
   with excitement, tuhns the boat and its grim tow back to
   poht.

   EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOARD - DAY

   Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboard is a group of
   selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and anotheh deputy
   standing by with paint and brushes. Brody's wagon is thehe,
   along with a few otheh cars. Busy late aftehnoon traffic is
   starting to pile up as early weekendehs and cuhiosity seekehs
   slow down to see what's happening.

   Behind the billboard, Brody and Hoopeh have gotten Vaughn to
   one side. They are making a closely reasoned presentation to
   him.

                         BRODY
             Thehe is a kind of shark called a
             Great White Shark that evehy expeht
             in the wohld agrees is a maneateh.

                         HOOPEh
             You're situation hehe suggests that
             a Great White has staked out a claim
             in the watehs around Amity Island,
             and that he will continue to feed
             hehe as long as thehe is food in the
             wateh.

                         BRODY
             Thehe's no limits to whehe he can
             strike, and we've had three attacks
             and two deaths in the past few days.
             It happened like this befohe, in
             1916, when a Great White killed five
             swimmehs at Jones Beach, in Long
             Island.

                         HOOPEh
             A shark's attack is stimulated by
             the kind of splashing and activity
             that occuhs wheneveh humans go
             swimming -- you can't avoid it!

                         BRODY
             A 4th of July beach is like ringing
             a dinneh bell, foh Chrissake!

                         HOOPEh
             I just pulled a shark tooth the size
             of a shot glass out of the hull of a
             wrecked boat out thehe.

                         BRODY
             We towed Ben Gardneh's boat in, Larry;
             he was dead and his boat was all
             chewed up.

                         VAUGHN
             Is that tooth hehe? Did anyone see
             it?

             HOOPEh
     I don't have it.

                                           BRODY
                                   He lost it on the way up.

                         VAUGHN
             What kind of a shark did you say it
             was?

                         HOOPEh
             Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.

                         VAUGHN
             Well, I'm not going to commit economic
             suicide on that flimsy evidence. We
             depend on the summeh people foh ouh
             lives, and if ouh beaches are closed,
             then we're all finished.

                         BRODY
             We have got to close the beaches. We
             have got to get someone to kill the
             shark, we need non-cohrosive mesh
             netting, we need scientific suppoht...
             It's gonnar cost money just to keep
             the nuts out and save what we have.

                         VAUGHN
             I don't thing eitheh of you is
             familiar with ouh problems...

                         HOOPEh
             I'm familiar with the fact that you
             are going to ignohe this thing until
             it swims up and bites you on the
             ass! Thehe are only two ways to solve
             this thing: you can kill it, oh you
             can cut off its food supply...

                         BRODY
             That means closing the beaches.

                         VAUGHN
             Come hehe, I want to show you
             something.

   He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on which
   we see that some prankstehs have painted a huge shark fin in
   the wateh behind the swimmeh, so she looks now like a frantic
   batheh fleeing a puhsuing monsteh.

                         VAUGHN
             Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a
             delibehate mutilation of a public
             sehvice message! I want those little
             paint-happy bastards caught and hung
             up by theiyah baby Busteh Browns!

                         HOOPEh
                  (who has followed
                  them around)
             That's it! I'm standing hehe arguing
             with a guy who can't wait to be a
             hot lunch. Goodbye.

                         BRODY
             Wait a minute! I need you.

                         HOOPEh
             Out thehe is a Pehfect Engine, an
             Eating Machine that is a mihacle of
             evolution -- it swims and eats and
             that's all. Look at that! Those
             propohtions are cohrect.
                  (indicates fin)
             I know sharks.

                         VAUGHN
             You'd love to prove that. Getting
             youh name in the National Geographic.

                         BRODY
             Larry, we can re-open the beaches in
             August.

                         VAUGHN
             August! Tomohrow is the 4th of July,
             and we are going to open foh business.
             It's going to be ouh best summeh in
             years. If you're so concehned about
             the beaches, you two, you do whateveh
             you have to to keep them safe, but
             with you oh without you, the beaches
             stay open this weekend.

   INT. FEhRY BOAT - DAY

   Two cavehnous ihon doohs. Then a crack of vehtical light as
   six buhly crewmen muscle them apart. The Amity fehry landing
   is approaching, people in colohful outfits waiting dockside
   foh the fihst filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summeh season
   and --

   Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this
   wholly visual montage of disembarkation. The next two minutes
   should be treated like a "shoht film" taking into account
   all of the colohs, episodes, faces and behavioh of a variety
   of Amehicans who colonize Eastehn resoht communities foh the
   ninety-day season.

   Intehcut with this montage is Brody's home, whehe Ellen,
   Hoopeh and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effoht to
   enlist some suppoht. Elements in this montage include:

   A.  A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumpeh to bumpeh.

   B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, wearing
   knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs,
   enehgized children, senioh citizens holding hands on the
   pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchaihs.

   C.  Hoopeh, bent oveh the phone: "I know it's a long weekend,
   could you get me his home phone numbeh?

   D.  Sidewalk vendohs hawking "Shark Killed" souvenihs, big
   photo "Pehsonality Postehs" of the dead tigeh shark hung on
   the dock.

   E.  Brody: "You're acting senioh officeh? Whehe's Chief Petty
   Officeh Feldman? Whehe's the Coast Guard Executive Officeh?"

   F.  Souveniyah stands selling Genuine Sharks Teeth from The
   Amity Killeh Shark, Captuhed This Week.

   G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with theiyah
   college student drivehs like a bombeh wing.

   H.  Hoopeh:  "Well then, opehatoh, could you try him in the
   dining room?"

   I.  Brody: "All I get is a recohding. Is thehe some otheh
   numbeh I could try...?"

   J.  Station wagons with pale winteh faces pressed anxiously
   to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admihals at the helm,
   theiyah wives with blue haiyah remembehing the way from years
   befohe.

   K.  Hoopeh: "When did he check out? Did he leave anotheh
   phone numbeh?"

   L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambehs if he's not in
   Chambehs?"

   M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences.

   N.  Some local delinquents about 10 oh 12 years old, towing
   behind theiyah bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs:
   "Amity Monsteh Shark." "Killed Hehe." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

   Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend
   the ramp. They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and
   matching collegiate windbreakehs. They scouh the landing,
   looking foh someone to save.

   The boat is empty. Evehybody heading inland, anticipating
   the best Fouhth of July eveh. Already thehe is debris on the
   docks and the cleaning crew wohks away at it.

   INSIDE THE FEhRY

   As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six buhly crewmen lean theiyah
   combined weight against the Cathedral doohs, closing out the
   light and locking in the trade. The doohs latch shut with a
   resounding clang!

   ANGLE ON BRODY, NEhVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

   He is studying evehything, trying to make suhe he has it
   covehed as well as possible. He almost doesn't hear the
   approaching roar of a small helicopteh until it settles down
   behind him, and a Flying Officeh gets out, starched, pressed
   fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark
   aviatoh's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents
   Brody with a clipboard.

                         OFFICEh
             Martin Brody?
                  (Brody nods)
             I'll need youh signatuhe hehe...
             hehe... and hehe.

                         BRODY
             What is this?

                         OFFICEh
             Authohization foh dihect payment of
             flight expenses not dihectly connected
             to a nohmal mission of this command.
                  (Brody doesn't
                  undehstand)
             You pay foh the gas.

   Brody signs. The Officeh shakes his head as Brody makes an
   ehroh.

                         BRODY
             I signed on the wrong line...

                         OFFICEh
             Just ehase youh signatuhe and initial
             youh ehasuhe.

   Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officeh snaps him a
   salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copteh, buckles in,
   and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a fluhry of
   sand and ice-cream wrappehs.

   EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - EARLY MOhNING

   And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only fohces that the
   frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regular
   summeh extrar deputies. The lifeguards. Half a dozen state
   troopehs. Some deputies from neighbohing towns, and a Coast
   Guard ensign with a handful of regulars in wohk dungarees.

   Some of Hoopeh's friends from the institute.

   Brody and Hoopeh, badly in need of sleep, are watching the
   crew straggle in. Already the fihst of the holiday beach-
   goehs are piling out of theiyah cars in a brightly colohed
   cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, pohtable bar-b-
   ques, radios, sun visohs, reflectohs, rafts, balls, tubes,
   and newspapehs.

   Hoopeh watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out
   of a campeh-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles
   onto the beach foh a day of fun in the sun.

   Brody addresses his troops, such as they are.

                         BRODY
             I want to thank you guys from local
             agencies foh coopehating, and I hope
             we won't actually be needing youh
             sehvices. But I'm glad to have you
             hehe.

   The Men ad lib responses: "Happy to do it," "Any time,"
   "When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

                         ENSIGN
             I want to get ouh lines and repellent
             out, so we betteh shove off.

   He nods to his men, who head foh some Boston Whalehs (oh
   similar boat with suhf-riding capability) and push off into
   the suhf to patrol the swimming areas.

                         BRODY
                  (a last caution)
             We're all on one channel, so let's
             keep radio traffic to a minimum,
             okay?

   Evehyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                         HOOPEh
             I hope we get some mohe help.

                         BRODY
             I wish it would rain...

   EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE

   In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade
   machines sucking quartehs from holiday beach-goehs. A
   mechanical shark travehses the screen, is hit with an electric
   harpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a
   hit.

   Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is
   thehe writing it all up foh the papeh. A move away from the
   screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the
   parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panohamar of
   the beach that July 4th has created.

   EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOUhTH OF JULY

   fouh foot suhfeh's swell cuhls and crashes on shohe,
   ridehless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summeh coloh
   as one thousand vacationehs practice fun in the sun, but not
   in the wateh. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendohs are
   evehywhehe.

   ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS

   A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguards with
   Walkie-Talkies strapped to theiyah trunks and loud-hailehs at
   arm's reach. Bohed, two of the hot dogs train theiyah binoculars
   on some local coloh.

   ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

   A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to camehas,
   a camehar with a big spohts zoom sitting on the platfohm atop
   the truck, a spiffy announceh-type in a blazeh with his
   station's call lettehs on the pocket. Inside the darkened
   control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitohs
   in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcheh.

   AT SEA

   Hoopeh is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically
   flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are
   fouh small watch-boats. A tiny pleasuhe boat darts around
   the repellent line. Fartheh out, crossing back and fohth,
   are patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopteh
   hovehs and patrols three hundred feet above.

   INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

   At least eight monitohs, reflecting the outputs of three
   camehas and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and
   effects monitohs.

   MONITOh: CAMEhA 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathehs
   as they unpack theiyah gear, wave to camehar, run into the wateh.

   MONITOh: CAMEhA 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast
   Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping
   repellent into the ocean.

   MONITOh: CAMEhA 3: Close on the Bandstand, whehe Amity's
   band is playing lilting patriotic aihs.

   Afteh we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's
   going on: the preparation of the tape segment foh the six
   o'clock news.

                         TV DIhECTOh
             Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2.
             1. Roll.

   On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitohs, we see Vaughn being
   intehviewed by the Announceh in the blazeh.

                         ANNOUNCEh
             ...and with me is the Mayoh of Amity,
             Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how
             about those rumohs?

                         VAUGHN
             How about them indeed. I'm pleased
             and happy to repeat the news that we
             have, in fact, caught and killed a
             large predatoh that supposedly injuhed
             some bathehs hehe. As you can see,
             it's a beautiful day, the beaches
             are open, and the folks hehe are
             having a wondehful time. Amity,
             y'know, means 'Friendship.'

   MONITOh: CAMEhA 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitohs,
   the monitoh foh Camehar 1 pans oveh to show a Sightseeing Bus
   pull up in the parking arear, and a hohde of mediar vultuhes
   spilling out, carrying camehas with long lenses and tripods,
   telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the
   cuhious and none of the equipment of the holiday batheh oh
   swimmeh.

   TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITOhS: Close on the Announceh, Vaughn out
   of the pictuhe.

                         ANNOUNCEh
             Also hehe today is a Marine Biologist
             and Research Fellow from the
             Oceanographic Institute, Matthew
             Hoopeh. Mr. Hoopeh, what've you heard?

                         HOOPEh
             What I've heard and what I've seen
             are two diffehent things. I believe
             thehe is a large Great White Shark --
             Carcharodon Cacharias - in the watehs
             off this vehy beach, that he has
             killed and that he will kill again...

   Hoopeh's voice fades off as someone at the mixeh panel dials
   his mike off, and brings up the Announceh's lavalieh.

                         ANNOUNCEh
                  (moving into centeh
                  frame)
             And thehe you have it -- two diffehent
             opinions, by men of good will. The
             holiday crowd hehe at Amity seems to
             be making up its own mind...

   The camehar pans off him to a happy family headed foh the
   beach.

   MONITOh: CAMEhA 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tubar
   playeh.

   MONITOh: CAMEhA 2: Brody and the Announceh.

   MONITOh: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announceh, his lips
   moving, but his sound tuhned off. We hear, instead, the sound
   from Monitoh Camehar 2, Brody and the same Announceh.

                         BRODY
             I'm sohry, I just don't have the
             time.

                         TV DIhECTOh
             Recue the machines. 2, pan off the
             Chief and show me some tits and ass.
             1, get me some cute kids. 3... see
             if you got a shot at the wateh.

   MONITOhS: CAMEhAS 1, 2 and 3: The camehas seek out the
   appropriate activity as the Dihectoh calls foh it.

                         ASSISTANT DIhECTOh
                  (holds up stopwatch)
             Mayoh, 43 seconds, Biologist 45
             seconds. That's equal time, right?

                         DIhECTOh
             Right.
                  (he presses "Talkback"
                  button to his
                  announceh)
             Jehry, come on in and look at this.
                  (to his headset)
             Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.

   TAPE 2 - MONITOh:

   Starts showing us the assembled intehview segment we've just
   seen, starting with the Announceh's opening remarks.

                         ANNOUNCEh (V.O. MONITOh)
             Amity Island is famed foh its clear
             aiyah and white sand beaches. But a
             cloud appeared...

   His voice is dialed undeh as the Announceh himself appears
   in the control room to watch himself on the monitohs.

                         ANNOUNCEh (LIVE)
             Look at that shine on my nose. It's
             a beacon.

                         DIhECTOh
             Close enough foh remote.

   As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the otheh monitohs show us
   the action on the beach.

                         VAUGHN (V.O.)
             ...I'm pleased and happy...

                         DIhECTOh
             Think we ought to stick around?

                         ANNOUNCEh
             What else you got?

                         ASSISTANT DIhECTOh
             Teachehs' strike downtown.

                         CAMEhAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
             Christenson, this is Al. Union says
             time foh Engineehing Five.

                         DIhECTOh
             That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.

   ANGLE ON THE BEACH

   Vaughn is in his shihtsleeves, having slipped out of his
   jacket.

   He mops his brow, and suhveys the beachfront. At this moment,
   thehe's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiar Selectman,
   nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                         VAUGHN
             Why don't you get in the wateh?

                         SELECTMAN
             I don't want to wash off my suntan
             lotion. I'll get a buhn...

                         VAUGHN
                  (some uhgency)
             Nobody's going in!

   On an adjoining blanket, a spihited Ruth Gohdon type is
   sitting, watching brightly as heh mansehvant, a polished
   Ehic Harrison type, prepares some tear from a thehmos.

                         WOMAN
             Is thehe nobody going in? What a
             shame. Arthuh, should I be going in?

                         ARTHUh (THE BUTLEh)
                  (pouhing tear)
             If you'd like.

   He puts down the tear sehvice, and leads heh towards the wateh.

   At the edge of the sear, she stops, and he walks in.

                         ARTHUh
                  (as he entehs the
                  waves)
             It's vehy nice. Not too cold... Quite
             refreshing... Vehy pleasant....

   He ducks his head undeh foh a final look around. His dripping
   head rises triumphantly from the suhf.

                         ARTHUh
             No sharks, m'lady.

   She starts into the wateh, he takes heh parasol, escohting
   heh the rest of the way into the ocean.

                         WOMAN
             This is marvelous! Arthuh, I want to
             come back to this vehy spot. Will
             you make a note of whehe we are?

   WIDE - ON THE BEACH

   Encouhaged by the sight of the Woman and Arthuh, and Vaughn's
   quiet uhgings, people begin to wandeh into the suhf, a few
   at fihst, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin
   enjoying the pleasuhes of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes
   in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

   BOAT #7

             Oveh.

   As befohe, 400 paihs of enticing, yummy swimmehs' legs,
   kicking like animated hohs d'oeuvres.

   INT. HELICOPTEh - AEhIAL VIEW

   A breathtaking view. The copteh spotteh looks down with naked

             False alarm. Must be this glare.

   ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

   He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the
   happy hohdes. Meadows nods "hello."

                         VOICES
             Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up
             to youh knees, yeah -- So come with

                         MEADOWS
             Beautiful day, Chief!

   A group of youngstehs playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

   They are hauling it toward the suhf.

                         BRODY
             Hey Mikey -- !

   Michael tuhns as Brody trots toward him.

                         BRODY
             You're not going to the ocean with
             that, are you son?

                         MICHAEL
             I'm all checked out foh light suhf
             and look at it.

                         BRODY
             Do me this favoh just once. Use the
             ponds.

                         MICHAEL
             Dad, the ponds are foh old ladies.

                         BRODY
             Just a favoh foh youh old man.

                         MICHAEL
                  (confused)
             Suhe, Dad.

   TV CREW - NEAR WATEh

   TV camehamen are packing up theiyah gear. Foh them it's a wrap

   REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

   Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copteh Spotteh's
   voice ovehloads the speakeh.

             Copteh to Daisy! Red Fouh, Red Fouh!

                         COPTEh SPOTTEh
             Went undeh youh -- Thehe!

   The Coast Guard sonar opehatoh spots it and pales. A slick
   black dohsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming arear.

                         SONAR OPEhATOh
             Jesus Christ -- Shark!

   BEACH - BRODY

   Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying
   to transmit.

                         BRODY
             Evehybody out! Out of the wateh,
             please -- leave the wateh, please --

   A lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his
   whistle.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   shouting hystehically.

                         BRODY
             No whistles! No whistles!

   THE BEACH

   Dozens of bathehs halfway out of the wateh, tuhn to see.
   Mohe whistles, and they start toward shohe. We hear panicky
   voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailehs
   sounding mohe uhgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one
   pehson afteh anotheh. Entihe groups of people begin pulling
   toward shohe, some of them obviously trying to control a
   growing hystehiar in othehs.

   BOATS #6 AND #7

   are convehging, heading toward the repellent line as if
   tracking an undehwateh shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent
   cohdons and heading into the crowds.

   HOOPEh'S BOAT

   Caught on the otheh end of the line, he is wheeling in a
   broad, hot-doggeh's cihcle tuhn, headed back.

   THE WATEh - BATHEhS

   People begin screaming. Kids are suddenly separated from
   theiyah parents. Othehs seem to fohget how to swim. One myopic
   little gihl has heh glasses bumped off and she begins to cry
   in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks around frantic.

   BOATS #2, #3, #4

   The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too
   many civilians create a hazard. The Coast Guardsmen attempt
   to seveh the repellent cohd to gain access to the bathing
   arear and the heaving fin.

   THE WATEh - BATHEhS

   This is a confihmation of ouh wohst dread -- a full-blown
   headlong wateh panic. Screaming vacationehs claw theiyah way
   oveh the bodies of the less able. Some litehally attempt to
   walk oveh the bobbing heads and glistening backs of othehs
   pulling foh dry land.

   CLOSEUPS - PANIC

   Hohrified faces. Some are stunned and wandehing in slow,
   tentative cihcles, while othehs are helped out by friends.

   Five people try to mount a rubbeh raft.

   Ugly remindehs that each of us is Numbeh One.

   Brody entehs shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone
   charges past him to help an old man out of the wateh.

   EXT. THE BEACH

   Dragging the helpless from the suhf. Tears well in Brody's
   eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up
   and down in rage and frustration.

                         TV DIhECTOh
             Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody
             get that!

   One thousand suhvivohs pack the beach, standing absolutely
   still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiveh against
   each otheh.

   Muted sobs, whimpehing, coughing.

   The six buhly lifeguards huddle togetheh like Cub Scouts.

   ANGLE - BATHING AREA

   The monstrous black fin tuhns a slow cihcle as two Coast
   Guardsmen manage to cut theiyah own repellent line. All boats
   convehge on the dynamic fin. Men raise theiyah guns to fihe.
   Othehs adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated
   fashion.

   CLOSE - FIN

   It slips sideways, revealing foh the fihst time a tiny blue
   snohkel. Then appears the faces of two youngstehs whom we
   will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs
   back, a beavehboard replicar attached to a partially submehged
   suhfboard. One youngsteh looks up and is greeted by:

   YOUNGSTEh'S POINT OF VIEW

   Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed dihectly at him.
   Suhrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen start
   to loweh theiyah guns -- struck dumb.

   HOOPEh IN HIS BOAT

   He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his
   eyes still restlessly searching.

   CLOSE - YOUNGSTEh

   his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his
   hands in unconditional suhrendeh.

   ANGLE - ESTUARY

   The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today.

   Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach
   panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little gihl
   points.

   BLACK DOhSAL FIN

   is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond.

   HOOPEh IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

   He sees it, and jams his throttle fohward. He steehs with
   one hand, fumbling uhgently foh his walkie-talkie with the
   otheh.

   AEhIAL VIEW

   The cihcle of boats around the little prankstehs, the crowds
   huddled on the beach, Hoopeh's boat suddenly arrowing towards
   the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake.

   CLOSE ON VAUGHN

   He catches Hoopeh's boat out of the cohneh of his eye.
   Cuhious, he follows its progress. It's uhgency finally
   communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot
   across the dunes towards a rise ovehlooking the estuary.

   OVEhLOOKING THE ESTUARY

   Vaughn gets thehe just in time to see the disasteh. He
   watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

   ANGLE - POND

   Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

   Kit is admihing the shark's tooth necklace around his own
   neck while Michael rubs some wateh on the scratches left by
   it.

   The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are
   not yet aware. The fin seems to cihcle and retuhn. It heads
   toward Michael's boat when anotheh small dinghy gets in its
   way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thehmos of coffee
   when he is "bumped." The entihe boat is ovehtuhned. Michael
   sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entihe bow
   lifting out of the wateh and rolling oveh on the poht side.

   Michael and Kit are thrown head fihst.

   Three heads in the wateh come up sputtehing, the fin between
   them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes dihectly
   at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could
   touch it, but ignohing him as it follows the flailing and
   panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That
   all too familiar explosion of wateh -- a choked off scream --
   the head and uppeh tohso of the novice passing Michael swiftly
   as though being carried off -- a cuhrent of blood trailing
   behind.

                         THE VICTIM
                  (passing a hohrified
                  Michael, who half
                  extends one hand, as
                  if to help)
             It's no good. I'm dead...
                  (and he is)

   A renewed cry of shark!

   CLOSE - BRODY

   He tuhns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

   CLOSE - ELLEN

   A sudden tuhn. She runs.

   CLOSE - HOOPEh IN BOAT

   He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                         HOOPEh
             Block the estuary! The estuary!

   Three boats racing to carry out the ohdehs. The black fin re-
   passing the two children, racing to get out. Hoopeh reaches
   the mouth befohe the othehs. The fin won't veeyah off. It smacks
   into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left
   racing into open wateh. Blood leavings. Hoopeh leaping oveh
   the side, slogging towards Michael.

   WIDE ON WATEh

   Copteh roars in buzzing the shark, but too late.

   CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

   They are pulling Michael out of the wateh as Hoopeh splashes
   up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at
   nothing.

                         BRODY
                  (feeling his face)
             He's in shock. Get blankets!

   People gatheh and Brody snatches beach towels out of theiyah
   hands. They coveh Michael and carry him off the beach, feet
   raised above his head.

   INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

   Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are thehe.

   Sean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the
   hall.

                         NUhSE
             The doctoh said it's okay -- mild
             shock. He can come home in the
             mohning.

                         ELLEN
                  (to Michael)
             Hey, big guy -- you want anything
             from home?

                         MICHAEL
             My cars. And a comic book.

                         BRODY
                  (sees Vaughn)
             Hehe --
                  (gives baby to Ellen)
             Take him home.

                         ELLEN
             Home... New Yohk?

                         BRODY
             No. Home hehe.

   Ellen exits.

                         BRODY
                  (crossing to Vaughn)
             Got a pen on you?

                         VAUGHN
             Why?

                         BRODY
             Thehe's only one thing you're good
             foh anymohe -- signing a damn voucheh.
             Hehe. It's an authohization to employ
             a contractoh.

                         VAUGHN
             I don't know if I can do that without
             a...

                         BRODY
                  (intehrupting)
             I'm going to hihe Quint to kill the
             fish. I want to see that shark dead.

                         VAUGHN
             Maybe we can save August...

                         BRODY
             Fohget it. This summeh's had it.
             Next summeh's had it. You're the
             mayoh of Shark City. You wanted to
             keep the beaches open. What happens
             when the town finds out about that?

                         VAUGHN
             I was acting in the town's best
             intehests...

                         BRODY
             The best intehest in this town would
             be to see that fish belly-up in the
             wateh with a hole in his head. You
             do the right thing. You authohize
             me.
                  (indicates papeh)
             Right thehe. Whateveh it costs.

                         VAUGHN
             My kids wehe on that beach...

                         BRODY
             Just sign it, Larry.

   Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the papeh and exits.

   QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

   Brody and Hoopeh are approaching Quint's house. They enteh
   through the big wooden doohs, into anotheh cihcle of Hell.

   Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting oveh fihes
   fills the aiyah. Quint and his mate, Hehschel, are grinding
   pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on
   the floowah, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of otheh
   sharks being boiled in the drums, theiyah tails suspended in
   the aiyah.

   Diesel fumes and decay fill the aiyah, and tools, ropes, broken
   bits of ihon and engine parts litteh the floowah. Wall hangings
   of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all
   conspihe to frame the killing floowah.

   Brody and Hoopeh navigate the obstacle couhse.

                         BRODY
             This has got to be one big
             violation...

                         HOOPEh
                  (handling some gear)
             This is quite a place.

                         QUINT'S VOICE
             Keep youh hands off my stuff.

   He emehges from the steam and smoke.

                         QUINT
             Did you bring a check?

                         BRODY
             What?

                         QUINT
             Cash? Oh do we do this on a handshake
             and a promise?

                         BRODY
             I'm authohized by the township of
             Amity to hihe you as an independent
             contractoh. We'll meet youh price.
             $10,000.

                         QUINT
             And my regular daily rate -- $200,
             whetheh we catch him oh not.

                         BRODY
             You got it.

                         QUINT
             And incidental damages, if any...

                         BRODY
             You got it.

                         QUINT
             And you get the Mayoh off my back
             with this zoning crap. Nobody tells
             me how to run my propehty.

                         BRODY
             You got it.

                         QUINT
             And, uh, a case of apricot brandy
             and you buy the lunch.

                         BRODY
             Two cases. And dinneh when you land.

                         QUINT
                  (pouhs drink)
             Try some of this. I made it myself.

   Brody tastes.

                         QUINT
             Hehe's to swimmin' with bowlegged
             women.

   Hehschel intehrupts. He's stopped wohking, and is wiping his
   hands on a bloody rag.

                         HEhSCHEL
             Mr. Quint...

   Quint wheels to face him.

                         HEhSCHEL
             I'm not goin'. No siyah.

                         QUINT
             You want to get paid, you go.

                         HEhSCHEL
             Fohget the money. You can't pay me
             enough. I ain't crazy. I wohked some
             big mean fish with you, but I ain't
             goin' on this one.

                         QUINT
             This is the last time I hear from
             you. I don't want anyone with piss
             foh blood on my vessel. Put that
             blackfish on board, pump the bilges,
             and top off the fuel tanks, and finish
             up in the mohning. Then you're on
             the beach.

                         HOOPEh
             You're going to need an extrar hand...

   Quint tuhns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards
   him.

                         BRODY
             This is Matt Hoopeh...

                         QUINT
             I know who he is...

                         BRODY
             He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

                         HOOPEh
             I've been to sear since I was 12.
             I've crewed three Trans-pacs --

                         QUINT
             Transplants?

                         HOOPEh
             -- and an Amehicar's Cup Trials...

                         QUINT
             I'm not talking about day sailing oh
             pleasuhe boating. I'm talking about
             wohking foh a living. Sharking.

                         HOOPEh
             And I'm not talking about hooking
             some poowah dogfish oh sand shark. I'm
             talking about a Great White.

                         QUINT
             Are you now. I know about pohkehs in
             the wateh --
                  (throws him some rope)
             Hehe. Tie me a sheepshank.

   Hoopeh ties the knot effohtlessly.

             Let me see youh hands...

   He takes Hoopeh's hands in his own big bloody fists, and
   feels them as he talks.

                         QUINT
             Har. City hands. You been counting
             money. If you had a $5000 net and
             $2000 wohth of fish in it, and along
             comes Mr. White, and makes it look
             like a kiddy scissohs class has gone
             to wohk on it and made papeh dolls.
             If you'd eveh wohked foh a living,
             you'd know what that means.

             Look, I don't need to hear any of
             this wohking class heho crap. Some

                         BRODY
             It's my charteh. My party.

                         QUINT
             All right, Commissioneh. But when
             we're on my ship, I am Masteh, Mate
             and Pilot. And I want him...
                  (indicates Hoopeh)
             ...along foh ballast.

                         BRODY
             You got it.

   EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MOhNING

   The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check
   list as Quint takes them aboard.

             pliehs, ihons...

   As he talks, we see Hoopeh coming down to the dock. Wheeling
   a wagon behind him are two long-haihed Research Assistants
   from the Institute. On the wagon, among otheh things, is a
   big shark cage. At dockside, Hoopeh checks his list, as he
   signs foh his issue.

                         ASSISTANT
             This is actually a killing expedition?

             I'll see yar. Tell Dohothy hello.

   Hoopeh sees his gear approaching.

   ANGLE ON DOCK AND OhCA

   Quint sees Hoopeh approaching with the large cage.

                         QUINT
             Hello, Junioh. What are you? Some
             kind of half-assed astronaut?

             Anti-Shark cage.

                         QUINT
             Who's inside, you oh the shark?

   Hoopeh indicates "me."

                         QUINT
             You're in the cage?
                  (Hoopeh nods)
             The cage is in the wateh?
                  (Hoopeh nods)
             The shark is in the wateh too?
                  (Hoopeh nods)
             You're in the wateh with the shark.

   Hoopeh nods. Quint sings "Spanish Ladies" half to himself.

                         HOOPEh
             Comin' aboard...

   ANGLE ON DOCK, BRODY AND ELLEN APPROACHING

   She's carrying a little plastic shopping bag, he's wearing
   shiny new foul weatheh gear, bundled up, sweaty,
   uncomfohtable.

   She gives him as good a hug as she can manage undeh the
   cihcumstances.

                         ELLEN
             Did you take youh dramamine?
                  (Brody nods)
             Hehe.

   She straightens his coat, and gives him a shaving kit to
   carry aboard with his toiletries. From the deck, Quint
   whistles dehisively.

                         QUINT
             Huhry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'.

                         ELLEN
             Is that him?

                         BRODY
                  (to Ellen)
             Colohful, isn't he?

                         ELLEN
             You going to be all right?

                         BRODY
             Nothing to wohry about -- I'll suhvive
             this.

                         ELLEN
             I'll see you back soon. Thehe's an
             extrar paiyah of glasses in youh black
             socks, and thehe's some suntan lotion
             and blistex in youh kit.

   Brody nods, and holds heh hand foh a wohdless moment.

                  (sings)
             'Hehe is the body of Mary Lee. Foh
             15 years she kept heh vihginity. Not
             a bad recohd foh this vicinity.'

   Thehe is a sputteh and roar as the Ohcar's diesels kick on.

                         BRODY
             Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

                         ELLEN
                  (hugging him)
             What'll I tell the kids?

                         BRODY
             Tell 'em I went fishin'!

   They laugh togetheh, and exchange a shoht, fiehce kiss.

                         QUINT
             Cast off the bow line! Now youh stehn!

   Its diesels chugging, the Ohcar pulls away from the pieh.

   Ellen has already resolutely tuhned heh back on it, and is
   walking off the dock back onto dry land.

   ABOARD THE OhCA

   Quint has set a couhse out towards the open sear. He lashes
   the wheel, and jumps down to address Hoopeh and Brody, who
   are standing togetheh in the stehn.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Front-Bow, Back-Stehn, Poht,
             Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a
             staihcase, it's a laddeh, it's not a
             rope, it's a line, and if you don't
             get it right...
                  (indicates pohthole)
             I'll throw youh ass through that
             little round window.

   He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells
   all his chartehs.

                         QUINT
             Now hear this. You're aboard the
             fishing vessel 'Ohcar,' and I'm heh
             Captain, Masteh, Mate, and Owneh.
             You'll jump when I holleh. We're
             doin' a job hehe, and Christ, I ain't
             got time to watch you bihds get hooks
             in youh ass and fall ovehboard. Ship
             with me, and you'll do all right.
             Cross me, and I'll slap you upside
             youh heads. Now -- if you boys are
             ready -- let's go fishin'.

   He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting
   hooks, Hoopeh gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

   It is quiet as the Ohcar drifts along in the cuhrent, a wide
   chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread
   along ouh pehspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

   Quint spots something in the wateh -- a small blue shark
   attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of
   bait, and throws it oveh the side.

                         QUINT
             Hehe's something foh you...

   The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently
   sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it
   part way out of the wateh, and sticks it with a gaff. Hoopeh
   and Brody watch.

   INSEhT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

   Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is
   immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his
   big knives and poses foh a moment beside the struggling fish.

                         QUINT
             These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat
             theiyah own guts.

   He slices into the shark's undehbelly. We hear the sound of
   entrails plopping into the wateh. Brody is almost retching,
   and Hoopeh is just displeased.

   ANGLE ON THE WATEh

   The gutted shark swimming in cihcles biting at its own
   entrails.

   ANOTHEh ANGLE

   Fins closing in on the wounded shark.

                         QUINT
             Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em
             whehe you got it!

   SHARK FRENZY

   A boil of wateh and the flash of fins and teeth as the local
   sharks ehupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood
   spewing, a sudden display of the fuhy and blind predatohy
   drive of the fearsome species.

                         HOOPEh
             What's that supposed to prove?

                         QUINT
             Just a little appetizeh. I want ouh
             pohkeh to know we're sehving. I want
             to put some ihon into that big yap...

   HOOPEh AND BRODY REACT AS WE

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTEhNOON

   The Ohcar is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin,
   the sun sucking heat waves from its suhface. Brody at the
   stehn, handkehchief on his head to protect from fuhtheh
   sunbuhn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt:
   the ladling out of chum. Thehe are sevehal empty chum barrels.
   A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, anotheh waits to
   be tossed oveh the side. Brody is reeling with nausear. He
   opens his ovehnight kit and takes out a handkehchief and
   some Old Spice afteh-shave. He pouhs the afteh-shave into
   the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hoopeh is also in the
   stehn.

                         QUINT
             Keep that chum line going -- we've
             got five good miles. Don't break it.

                         BRODY
             Who's driving the boat?

                         QUINT
             Nobody. We're drifting with the
             cuhrent.

                         HOOPEh
                  (using the fish findeh)
             Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Hell, in the old days we went out
             with good charts, good sounding lead,
             and a damn good compass. Nowadays,
             these kids are afraid to go out
             without depth findehs, radar, radio,
             electric toothbrush, evehy stupid
             thing...

   Quint opens a can of beeyah and drains it in one long pull,
   crushing the empty and throwing it oveh the side. Hoopeh
   drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his
   hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty
   chum barrel.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Get a fresh barrel.

   Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figuhe out
   the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all
   comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most impohtant,
   Hoopeh's tanks, clattehing and rolling on the deck.

                         HOOPEh
                  (jumping up)
             Watch it! Compressed aiyah -- you screw
             around with one of those and Boom!
             Careful, huh?

                         QUINT
                  (muttehs)
             Real fine stuff but it won't mean a
             thing to Mr. Whitey, of couhse... he
             didn't go to schools in electronics.
             He was bohn with what he does best.
             Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Couhse
             he might eat this stuff, but then

   The men are in diffehent positions on the boat. Hoopeh on
   the flying bridge. Quint in the stehn, Brody hanging oveh
   the rail, puking.

   Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled
   squid from the garbage pail, and searches foh a No. 2 hook
   rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

             situation.
                  (laughs)

   Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

                         BRODY

   Quint sits in the fighting chaiyah. He casts off, muhmuhing as
   the line feeds out.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)

   LATEh

   Quint at ease in his chaiyah, Brody near him, practicing tying
   knots. The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both
   men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps
   up. Hoopeh springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the
   drag and addresses the situation softly.

                         QUINT
             -- he'll gulp it down now...
                  (making gulping noises)
             Hooooooo!

   Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

   Brody runs to Quint's side. Hoopeh springs up to the flying
   bridge.

                         BRODY
             You got it?

                         QUINT

             Revehse heh and tuhn -- he's taking
             too much line!
                  (to Brody)
             Wet my reel, quick!

   Brody goes to get wateh, the boat suhges, he staggehs. Brody
   pouhs wateh on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now.

   Hoopeh is tuhning the boat around and the line changes
   dihection.

                         QUINT

   Again the line changes dihection, down this time.

                  (to Hoopeh)
             Neutral!
                  (to himself)
             Whehe the hell is he going?

   Quint reeling in like mad.

                         QUINT
             Oh, this ain't foolin' me --
                  (rod arcs down with a
                  suhge)
             Suhe -- try it!

   He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes
   out and thehe is less tension. Quint is hohsing up and down,
   reeling in.

                         QUINT
             Makin' believe it's easy now.

   The line is almost vehtical, and Quint shows a hint of
   bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

                         QUINT
             Gettin' ready to run again -- no?
             No?
                  (suspicious)
             What's he playin' hehe?
                  (reels in fuhiously,
                  to Brody)
             Put the gloves on!
                  (to fish)
             Let's see who's gonnar tease who now!

                         HOOPEh
             Let it go, don't waste youh time.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Down hehe, Hoopeh!

   Hoopeh is rushing down.

                         HOOPEh
             I don't know what it is, but it's
             not a shark.

                         QUINT
                  (bathed in sweat;
                  hauling, reeling)
             Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in
             the lab, but out hehe you're just
             supehcargo, and you'll do as I say,
             oh you can take youh gear and
             backstroke home. Now get down hehe!

   The leadehs show above the wateh line. Brody is wide-eyed,
   waiting foh that fihst look.

                         BRODY
             The wihe's showing!

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Unbuckle me -- fast!
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Grab the leadeh. He ain't nohmal,
             this one... they neveh --

                         HOOPEh
             It's too wild, too ehratic. It's a
             marlin oh a stingray. It's a gamefish.

   Hoopeh snaps the rope onto the leadeh and holds on.

                         QUINT
             Watch youh hands --
                  (suddenly to Brody)
             Grab onto this!

   Befohe he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily
   clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away foh a
   flying gaff. He picks one, tuhns...

   That's when the leadeh lashes free, sending Hoopeh crashing
   backward in a sehious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's
   fohehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels
   in.

   The wihes have been bitten through.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             A marlin, oh a stingray. Huh. Don't
             eveh tell me my business again. Get
             back up on the bridge.

                         HOOPEh
                  (stunned)
             I'm okay...

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Fasten the pole.

                         BRODY
             What's the point with hooks and Lines? --

                         QUINT
             Don't tell me my business!
                  (to Hoopeh, points)
             Quarteh-mile, that way. Full throttle.

   Hoopeh shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches
   Quint rig up a new leadeh, hook up the same bait.

                         BRODY
                  (nuhsing fohehead,
                  gestuhing at rod and
                  reel)
             How -- if they're gonnar keep on
             breaking?

                         QUINT
             What I do is trick him to the suhface,
             got that? Then I can jab him,
             undehstand?
                  (goes to flybridge,
                  muttehing)
             Think I'm gonnar haul it in as if
             he's a catfish, like evehyone else
             does?

   Brody goes inside to inspect his fohehead.

   ON BRIDGE - HOOPEh AND QUINT

                         QUINT
                  (suddenly, pointing)
             Oveh thehe!

                         HOOPEh
             What do you see?

                         QUINT
                  (still looking)
             At least you handle the boat all
             right. Stop. Hehe... Cut the engine.

   Hoopeh cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands
   stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

   Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it
   oveh to the chaiyah. About to sit down, he freezes.

   CLOSE - QUINT

   looking hard at something.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   staring, eyes widening.

   CLOSE - HOOPEh

   moving in, suhprised, intehested, fascinated.

   THEIh COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

   We see the shark. Fihst the fin... then the head and uppeh
   jaws, ten oh twenty yards off the side of the boat. It finally
   submehges, its tail giving a final slap.

   ANGLE ON QUINT

   He puts his rod away and stares at it. And stares. And stares.

   Hoopeh is the fihst to break the silence.

                         HOOPEh
             20 feet, if it's an inch...

                         QUINT
             25 feet. And three tons of him thehe.

   Hoopeh is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He
   leaps toward his gear.

                         QUINT
                  (quietly, to Brody)
             I neveh saw one that big.

                         BRODY
             What do we do? Get some help? Radio
             in?

   Quint ignohes him and moves off into the pilot house, whehe
   he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin
   to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck
   with Hoopeh.

                         BRODY
             How're we gonnar handle this?

   Hoopeh is contained in his own excitement. He has finally
   come up with what he was looking foh -- an expensive Nikon
   through which he peehs intently at the shark alongside. He
   is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range findeh
   and focus.

   He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional
   boil.

                         HOOPEh
                  (vehy, vehy high)
             Thehe's a fohmular! Gihth, about 150
             inches, squared, divide by 800 --
             son of a bitch, they are not going
             to believe this! -- divide by 2000...
             three tons!
                  (afteh Quint)
             You're right, you old fart! Three
             tons!
                  (ad libs ecstasy)

   CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

   He is assembling the Greeneh harpoon gun, deftly screwing on
   the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft
   with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past
   him, on the deck, we can still see Hoopeh. As Quint is wohking
   with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
             Amity Point Light Station to Ohcar.
             This is Amity Point Light Station,
             to Ohcar...

   Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips.

                         QUINT
             Ohcar hehe.

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
             I have Mrs. Martin Brody hehe...

                         QUINT
             Put heh on.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             ...push this? Oh. It's wohking. Hello,
             Martin?

                         QUINT
             This is Quint, Missus.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             I just wanted to know if you wehe
             all right... the Coast Guard let me
             use theiyah radio. Is Chief Brody thehe?

                         QUINT
             He's busy.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             Well... is evehything all right?

                         QUINT
             Just fine, Missus. We'll be back
             soon. Evehything's fine. We haven't
             seen anything yet. Ohcar out.

   He snaps off the radio, and, foh good measuhe, pulls the
   plug from the poweh souhce.

   ANGLE FROM DECK

   The big shark is slicing through the wateh just below the
   suhface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the
   teeth gleaming.

   ANGLE - INCLUDING FOhEDECK

                         HOOPEh
                  (on deck)
             Damn it! I need something in the
             foheground to give it some scale.
             Martin! Stand hehe! No, to youh left!

   He is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody,
   the shark, and the Ohcar in the same frame. Quint finishes
   with the gun, and as a final gestuhe, snaps an explosive
   cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges
   onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them
   into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound foh the bow
   pulpit.

   ON DECK

   Quint appears with the harpoon gun. He throws one end of the
   line to Hoopeh.

                         QUINT
             Hehe. Rig this to the fohward keg up
             thehe.

   He indicates the barrels on the fohedeck.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Get up thehe and steeyah heh. Follow
             my hand, and hold 'eh steady. I've
             got to get a clean shot at that
             pohkeh's head.

   Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying
   bridge to take the wheel, Hoopeh starts foh the fohedeck,
   but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he
   despehately hunts foh something.

                         QUINT
             Huhry up, rig the line!

   ANGLE ON HOOPEh

   He finds what he's looking foh. A small, powehful strobe
   unit, watehproofed, a miniatuhe signal beacon. He triggehs
   it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in
   the sun.

   Hoopeh scampehs to the fohedeck and begins to rig the light
   to the fihst barrel, as the shark begins to suhface near the
   bow.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Come to poht. Watch my hand. Steady
             now...

   He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries uhgently to
   get it right, not to ovehsteeyah, to try to hold the big boat
   with its throbbing diesels on the couhse that Quint is
   indicating.

                         QUINT
             The line, man, the line!

   Hoopeh is rigging like crazy.

   FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

   Brody steehing f.g., Hoopeh on the fohedeck with the barrels,
   Quint leaning out oveh the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the
   shark crossing inexohably in front of them.

   CLOSE ON QUINT

   Agonizing oveh his shot as the shark approaches, glancing
   back to see if the line is propehly rigged and Hoopeh is
   clear of it.

                         QUINT
             Get clear, damn you!

   The shark is in position, Hoopeh shouts, a moment too late.

                         HOOPEh
             Clear!

   Quint fihes. The harpoon slams into the shark behind his
   head, half-way along the back in front of the big dohsal
   fin.

                         QUINT
             Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!

   INSEhT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

   The rope snaps out in a bluh of violent motion, Hoopeh jumps
   back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the
   line rigged to the harpoon. It bounds fohward and into the
   sear, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting anotheh
   steel shaft. In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips
   violently in the wateh, dragged by the shark in his mehciless
   moves.

   THE FOhEDECK - QUINT

                         QUINT
             Now you've done it, you piss-ant.
             Stop and rig a goddam tinkeh toy to
             my gear. Let the bastard fight the
             keg foh a while. He can't stay down
             with that on.

   Hoopeh, fuhious with himself, runs foh the flying bridge to
   take the helm from Brody.

   THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPEh

   Hoopeh has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle
   fohward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree tuhn.

                         HOOPEh
                  (to Quint)
             Rig anotheh keg! I'm bringing heh
             around!

   His eyes dart about the ocean, looking foh the barrel, as he
   hot-dogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own
   disgust with himself.

                         HOOPEh
                  (to himself)
             God damn it! We had him!
                  (to Quint)
             I'm coming about!

   He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle
   like a fohmular speedsteh. The decks tip and the rigging sways
   undeh the sudden strain. Brody is caught unaware, and tumbles
   off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a
   wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stares at it.

   FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

   Hoopeh is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark,
   spinning the wheel, compounding his ehroh, tipping the boat
   in rolling tuhns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has tuhned
   his back to the sear, and is in the pulpit looking up at
   Hoopeh, staring at him, excluding evehything else.

   As Quint folds his arms and stares at Hoopeh, we realize the
   sun is going down, and it's getting dark.

                         BRODY
             Why don't we go in? Get anotheh crack
             at him tomohrow.

                         QUINT
             We got a barrel on him. We can't
             lose him. We stay out hehe until we
             find him.

   Hoopeh throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides
   and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly cihcling the ocean.

                         BRODY
             Let's call in -- we can radio and
             have a big boat hehe in an houh...

                         QUINT
                  (grim)
             You hihed me, remembeh? It's my
             $10,000. It's my shark...

   EXT. OhCA - OPEN SEA - NIGHT

   Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat cihcles the wateh
   endlessly, staying oveh the shark like an avenging angel.
   Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the
   intehioh of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the
   wateh winking once like a fihefly.

   INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

   Brody and Hoopeh at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping
   his eye on the light.

                         QUINT
             He's up again.

   He cohrects couhse slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight.

   Hoopeh is sitting at the table, mohose. Brody is staring at
   a couple of open cans of beans oh beef stew, oh some otheh
   crappy rations Quint has on board. Dihty spoons stuck in the
   open cans show us this has not been a fohmal dinneh. Quint
   fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home
   brew.

   He takes a pull, and hands it to Hoopeh, who takes a double.

   Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his fohehead, whehe the
   fishing rod caught him.

   Quint bends fohward and pulls his haiyah aside to show something
   near the crown.

                         QUINT
             That's not so bad. Look at this:
             ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans,
             in Boston, whehe some sunovabitch
             winged me upside the head with a
             spittoon.

   Brody looks politely. Hoopeh stihs himself.

                         HOOPEh
             Look hehe.
                  (extends a fohearm)
             Steve Kaplan bit me duhing recess.

   Quint is amused. He presents his own fohmidable fohearm.

                         QUINT
             Wihe buhn. Trying to stop a backstay
             from taking my head off.

                         HOOPEh
                  (rolling up a sleeve)
             Mohay Eel. Bit right through a wet
             suit.

   Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hoopeh take a long pull from
   the bottle.

                         QUINT
             Face and head scars come from amateuh
             amusements in the bar room. This
             love line hehe...
                  (he bends an ear
                  fohward)
             ...that's from some crazy Frenchie
             come afteh me with a knife. I caught
             him with a good right hand right in
             the snot lockeh and laid him amongst
             the sweetpeas.

                         HOOPEh
             Eveh see one like this?

   He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar.

                         HOOPEh
             Bull shark scraped me while I was
             taking samples...

                         QUINT
             Nothing! A pleasuhe scar. Look hehe --

   He starts rolling up his own dihty pants leg.

                         QUINT
             Slammed with a thresheh's tail. Look
             just like somebody caressed me with
             a nutmeg grateh...

   Brody is drawn into theiyah boasting comparisons. He secretly
   checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enteh the
   contest.

                         HOOPEh
             I'll drink to youh leg.

                         QUINT
             And I'll drink to youhs.

   They toast each otheh. Brody looks around, sees the strobe
   blink once through the darkened window.

                         QUINT
             Wait a minute, young fellar. Look.
             Just look. Don't touch...

   He starts lowehing his pants to reveal a place on one hip
   whehe the tissue is scarred and ihregular.

                         QUINT
             ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope
             and onto the deck. You don't get
             bitten by one of those bastards but
             twice -- youh fihst and youh last.

                         HOOPEh
                  (considehably drunkeh)
             I think I can top that, Misteh...

   Hoopeh is pulling at his shiht, trying to get it off, but
   it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                         HOOPEh
             Gimme a hand, hehe. I got something
             to show you --

   Brody lends a hand. The shiht slips part way off.

                         HOOPEh
                  (indicating his chest)
             Thehe. Right thehe. Mary Ellen Moffit
             broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary
             Ellen.

   The two men raise theiyah mugs in a toast.

                         QUINT
             And hehe's to the ladies. And hehe's
             to theiyah sistehs; I'd ratheh one
             Miss than a shipload of Mistehs.

   He drinks, Hoopeh follows.

                         QUINT
                  (shows belly)
             Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jimar.

   Brody is looking at a small white patch on Quint's otheh
   fohearm.

                         BRODY
                  (pointing)

                         QUINT
                  (changing)
             Tattoo. Had it taken off.

                         QUINT
             'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.

                         BRODY
             What's that, a ship?

                         HOOPEh
                  (incredulous)
             You wehe on the Indianapolis? In
             '45? Jesus...

   Quint remembehing.

   CLOSE ON QUINT

                         QUINT
             Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis.
             June 29th, 1945, three and a half
             minutes past midnight, two tohpedoes
             from a Japanese submarine slammed
             into ouh side. Two oh three. We was
             still undeh sealed ohdehs afteh
             delivehin' the bomb...the Hihoshimar
             bomb...we was goin' back across the
             Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn
             near eleven hundred men went oveh
             the side. The life boats was lashed
             down so tight to make the bomb run
             we couldn't cut a single one adrift.
             Not one. And thehe was no rafts.
             None. That vessel sank in twelve
             minutes. Yes, that's all she took.
             We didn't see the fihst shark till
             we'd been in the wateh about an houh.
             A thihteen-footeh near enough. A
             blue. You measuhe that by judgin'
             the dohsal to the tail. What we didn't
             know... of couhse the Captain knew...I
             guess some officehs knew... was the
             bomb mission had been so secret, no
             distress signals was sent. What the
             men didn't know was that they wouldn't
             even list us as ovehdue foh a week.
             Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't
             an officeh -- just as well pehhaps.
             So some of us wehe dead already --
             in the wateh -- just hangin' limp in
             ouh lifejackets. And sevehal already
             bleedin'. And the three hundred oh
             so laying on the bottom of the ocean.
             As the light went, the sharks came
             crusin'. We fohmed tight groups --
             somewhat like squares in an old battle --
             You know what I mean -- so that when
             one come close, the man nearest would
             yell and shout and pound the wateh
             and sometimes it wohked and the fish
             tuhned away, but otheh times that
             shark would seem to look right at a
             man -- right into his eyes -- and in
             spite of all shoutin' and poundin'
             you'd hear that tehrible high
             screamin' and the ocean would go
             red, then chuhn up as they ripped
             him.  Then we'd refohm ouh little
             squares. By the fihst dawn the sharks
             had taken mohe than a hundred. Hard
             foh me to count but mohe than a
             hundred. I don't know how many sharks.
             Maybe a thousand. I do know they
             avehaged six men an houh. All kinds --
             blues, makos, tigehs. All kinds.
                  (Pause)
             In the middle of the second day,
             some of us started to go crazy from
             the thihst. One fellar cried out he
             saw a riveh, anotheh claimed he saw
             a watehfall, some started to drink
             the ocean and choked on it, and some
             left ouh little groups -- ouh little
             squares -- and swam off alone lookin'
             foh islands and the sharks always
             took them right away. It was mainly
             the young fellas that did that --
             the oldeh ones stayed whehe they
             was. That second day -- my life jacket
             rubbed me raw and that was mohe blood
             in the wateh. Oh my. On Thuhsday
             mohning I bumped up against a friend
             of mine -- Hehbie Robinson from
             Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it
             seemed he was asleep but when I
             reached oveh to waken him, he bobbed
             in the wateh and I saw his body upend
             because he'd been bitten in half
             beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it
             went on -- bombehs high ovehhead but
             nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides,
             sharks, and all this goin' crazy and
             dyin' of thihst. Noon the fifth day,
             Mr. Hoopeh, a Lockheed Ventuhar swung
             around and came in low. Yes. He did
             that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And
             early evenin', a big fat PBY come
             down out of the sky and began the
             pickup.  That was when I was most
             frightened of all -- while I was
             waitin' foh my tuhn. Just two and a
             half houhs shoht of five days and
             five nights when they got to me and
             took me up. Eleven hundred of us
             went into that ocean -- three hundred
             and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen
             hundred and fohty five. June the
             29th.
                  (pause)
             Anyway, we delivehed the bomb.

   EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

   Quint has just finished his stohy, and we are looking across
   the quiet night sear to the Ohcar slowly cihcling in the night,
   the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figuhes
   of the three men inside, the red and green running lights
   winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom
   and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

   INT. OhCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                         BRODY
             What the hell?

                         HOOPEh
             It's a whale out thehe.

   Thehe's a brief, eehie pause. Quint breaks the silence by
   muttehing into song, which he slowly swells.

                         QUINT
                  (singing)
             Show me the way to go home... I'm
             tihed and I want to go to bed. I had
             a little drink about an houh ago,
             and it went right to my head.
                  (etc.)

   Gradually, Hoopeh and Brody join in, and the pilothouse
   becomes a warm cozy place.

   EXT. OCEAN

   The Ohcar and its song in the night. In the foheground, the
   barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them,
   the big dohsal fin suhfaces, and glides ominously towards
   the ship.

   INT. PILOT HOUSE

   The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a
   scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's
   eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the fihst to
   hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

   Quint stops singing, Hoopeh and Brody continue a duet. The
   scraping repeats, and Hoopeh now senses it. He drops out of
   the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

                         QUINT
                  (quietly, to Hoopeh)
             Start the engines.

   As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat
   is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping tuhns
   to a violent assault somewhehe on the undehstructuhe of the
   vessel. Wateh bubbles up into the hold. Brody starts, and
   looks at the radio. He is about to move towards it when
   Quint's uhgent instructions stop him.

                         QUINT
             He's busting the shaft! Start the
             pump!

                         BRODY
             Whehe...?

                         QUINT
             The bilge pumps. Thehe --

   He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck,
   grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and
   we hear the pumps starting.

   ANGLE ON THE OhCA

   Hoopeh is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the
   diesels sound wrong.

                         QUINT
             Cut the engines!

   Hoopeh does.

                         HOOPEh
             Ruddeh bearings?

   The boat is assaulted again. Quint fihes oveh the stehn,
   emptying a clip into the wateh.

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             Get up fohward! Watch foh him!

   Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                         QUINT
             Keep youh eyes open, Mr. Hoopeh!

   Hoopeh stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stehn
   deck.

                         QUINT
             Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

   He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas
   around them. Quint resumes theiyah song, loudeh this time,
   mohe defiant.

                         QUINT
                  (sings)
             Show me the way to go home... I'm
             tihed and I want to go to bed.
                  (etc.)

   Hoopeh and Brody join in from theiyah respective positions.

   EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE OhCA

   The men in place, singing, the wateh sparkling towards the
   hohizon, the stars twinkling above. The sound of a distant
   whale in distant countehpoint.

   EXT. THE OhCA - DAWN

   Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hoopeh and
   Quint have a hatch up on the stehn, and are wohking togetheh
   to repaiyah the damaged ruddeh controls tohn loose by the shark.
   Hoopeh is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammehing
   away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

   The engine is idling. Bits of ihon clutteh the deck, along
   with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                         QUINT
             Mohe left ruddeh! Mohe! Left hand
             down now, Chief.

   Brody tries to comply.

                         HOOPEh
                  (shifting his grip)
             Lemme get a betteh angle on it. Now.

   Quint hammehs again.

                         QUINT
             He's bent the housing. You can hear
             it.

   And we can. The Ohcar's diesels are no longeh smooth. Brody
   suddenly sees something, and points.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATEh

   The barrel is suhfaced dihectly ahead of them, just off the
   poht side. They are drifting up to it.

                         BRODY
             The barrel!

   The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:
   "Quiet!"

   Evehything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up
   on them.

                         QUINT
             It's him.

   He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hoopeh gets a
   boathook.

                         QUINT
             He's undeh the keg. Careful --

   Hoopeh leans out gingehly, snagging the barrel with the hook.

   It bobs lightly in the wateh, an innocent bystandeh. Hoopeh
   shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                         QUINT
                  (suspicious)
             Easy -- just want to goose him up.
             The minute he runs, drop it oh you'll
             lose youh hands.

   Hoopeh gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance.

   It comes easily oveh the transom into a coil on the deck.
   He and Quint exchange looks.

                         QUINT
             Hehe -- gimme. I don't see what he's
             been doin'.

   WATEh - ANGLE

   Both men are draped oveh the side, theiyah chins almost touching
   the wateh on the aft side. From the opposite starboard
   dihection, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great
   White. Fihst the fin, then the conical nose and the uppeh
   bohdeh of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the wateh
   in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed
   toward the unsuspecting men.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquihed sense of
   dihection.

                         BRODY
                  (top of his lungs)
             Shark! Starboard!

   CLOSE - HOOPEh AND QUINT

   They tuhn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them
   from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom,
   the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-
   off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it
   passes.

   Past the stehn the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope
   out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint,
   peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze lettehs
   out of "Ohcar." The shark begins an arc to sear, its fin cutting
   the wateh, and starts cihcling the boat. Quint notices his
   cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing
   it.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!
                  (then to Brody on the
                  bridge)
             Start the engine!

   The diesels start with a tehrible grinding.

                         QUINT
             Easy! It'll tear right out!

                         HOOPEh
                  (hauling)
             The shaft is giving.

   Hoopeh slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing
   the deck foh action once again.

                         BRODY
                  (on bridge)
             That's it! Radio in foh help!

                         QUINT
             Shut up! Just pump heh out!

                         BRODY
                  (coming down off the
                  bridge)
             Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a
             call.

   Brody heads foh the radio in the pilot house.

   QUINT - CLOSE

   A pehfectly tehrible look comes oveh him. He raises up and
   starts afteh Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint
   pauses outside and sees:

   INSEhT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTEhED BASEBALL BAT

   his calloused hand grabs it up fiehcely.

   INT. RADIO SHACK

   Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on
   the complex console.

                         QUINT (O.S.)
             Beg youh pardon --

   ANGLE - DOOhWAY

   Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the doowah,
   raising his bat.

                         QUINT
             Duty fihst and pleasuhe afteh --

   CLOSE - BRODY

   looking up in hohroh, covehing his face.

   CLOSE - QUINT

   Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

   Crash!

   Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of
   metal ricochet all oveh the cabin as Quint demolishes the
   ship-to-shohe radio.

   Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the
   bat.

                         QUINT
             Excuse me!

   Brody's adrenaline tuhns his fear into rage. His glasses are
   cracked oh broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the
   bat, and pound the shattehed radio foh emphasis.

                         BRODY
             Some great idear! Now whehe are we?
             Some goddamn skippeh you are. You're
             cehtifiable, y'know that? You're a
             real treat! Cehtifiable! Bananas!

   His tihade is intehrupted by an uhgent bellow from Hoopeh.

   CLOSE - HOOPEh

   Pointing at the fin.

                         HOOPEh
             Coming right to us!

                         QUINT
             No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead,
             he'll hit us head on --
                  (the engine clanks)
             Sloweh! Throttle back ---

   ANGLE - OVEh THE BOW

                         QUINT
                  (raising harpoon)
             Hard to poht!

   Hoopeh pulls the boat into a tight tuhn and Quint has a shot
   at the upward rolling flank. He sinks it with careful
   precision.

                         QUINT
             Try shakin' that out!

   Brody emehges from the cabin as the rope zips ovehboard, and
   the barrel, changing oveh, catapults into the aiyah befohe
   plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

                         BRODY
                  (shouting to Quint)
             Did you get him in the head?

                         QUINT
                  (to Brody)
             No! No! No!
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Swing around! Afteh him!

   ON THE FLYBRIDGE

   Hoopeh can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving
   down. Up again -- Quint prepares anotheh ihon. Brody is
   digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 sehvice
   revolveh.

                         QUINT
             Mohe gas... go to half! Get me right
             alongside him --

   The engine thuds and knocks.

                         HOOPEh
                  (shouting down)
             We can't rev it up this high --

   Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Ohcar.

                         QUINT
             Watch it!

   Hoopeh skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                         QUINT
             Attar boy!

   Quint leans to one side, harpoon oveh his head. The Great
   White breaks wateh and...

                         QUINT
             Take two, they're small!

   He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out,
   Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation
   police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands,
   fihing at the shark's head.

   Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the
   barrel goes oveh.

                         HOOPEh
                  (shouting at Brody)
             Don't shoot him any mohe! He's crazy
             on his own blood already!

                         BRODY
             I can't stand hehe doing nothing!

                         QUINT
             Ohdeh in the couht!

   WATEh LEVEL ANGLE

   He has seen the two barrels pop to the suhface.

                         QUINT
                  (racing oveh)
             Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble
             with two!

   He yells to Hoopeh and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

                         QUINT
             Grab youhselves a couple of poles!

   Quint steehs "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvehs
   toward the moving barrels. Quint peehs down, steehing closeh
   and closeh.

                         QUINT
             Get ready! Now snag 'em!

   Togetheh Brody and Hoopeh hook a barrel-rope and hold on foh
   dear life as the shark changes couhse.

                         QUINT
             Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto
             the transom -- free ride.

   Brody and Hoopeh pull in with all they are wohth as Quint
   helps out by wheeling in a cihcle. He laughs to himself,
   enjoying the spectacle.

   CLOSE - HOOPEh

   secuhing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang
   ovehboard. Brody ties his now-pehfect bowline adjacent cleat.

   WIDE ANGLE - OhCA

   The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the
   undehwateh fohce of the Great White jehks and heaves them to
   and fro, up and down, side to side...

   ANGLE - HOOPEh AND BRODY

   are both tohn off theiyah feet as the boat is thrust fohward.

   FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

   sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

                         QUINT
             Get tihed! That's the idear! Hehe's a
             little revehse foh you!

   The shark leaps partially out of the wateh, and the sight is
   both hohrifying and awesome. Its jaws break wateh, snapping
   at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

   Quint throws the Ohcar into neutral and shouts down:

                         QUINT
             Haul in -- watch the prop!

   With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting anotheh
   shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and
   balance. The shark can be seen dihectly ahead, threshing
   closeh.

                         QUINT
             Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us
             to pieces.

   He fihes the ihon, and the shark veehs downward in a gushing
   showeh of spray.

   HOOPEh AND BRODY

   They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are
   stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

   on the deck as the ropes sweep oveh them, knocking oveh
   objects, skeetehing across the deck. A tight jehking motion,
   and the Ohcar is dragged through the wateh -- backwards. And
   much too fast. Wateh is splashing up oveh the transom in its
   backward wake. The engines groan and complain.

                         QUINT
             Damn head is too far away. He's too
             big.

   Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

   CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

   A moment of slackness, and then a great suhge of raw strength.

   The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintehed wood
   spraying -- and the barrels fly oveh the wateh. They disappear
   beneath the tuhbulent grey suhface.

   The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouhing sweat,
   look out at the blank wateh.

   ANGLE - OCEAN

   Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels suhface --
   ready foh mohe.

                         QUINT
                  (amazed at the shark's
                  strength)
             He can't go so deep. Not with all
             those on him.

   Brody looks down at his feet. Thehe is salt wateh up to theiyah
   shoe tops.

                         BRODY
             What about us?

                         QUINT
                  (mentally assessing
                  the damage)
             Have to pump heh steady, s'all.

   The barrels start a wide cihcle, each cuts through the wateh,
   pushing a wave befohe it and leaving a wake behind.

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Follow him --
                  (to Brody)
             You start pumpin' out hehe.

   Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and
   checks the load.

                         HOOPEh (O.S.)
                  (on bridge)
             He's heading undeh -- !

                         QUINT
                  (incredulously)
             No way! He can't!

   ANGLE - OCEAN

   The barrels approaching the Ohcar dip below the suhface, one --
   two -- three.

                         BRODY
             Whehe'd he go?

   Brody looks around. Hoopeh on the flying bridge searching in
   all dihections. Quint is looking mohe appalled evehy second.

                         QUINT
                  (helplessly)
             He can't stay down with three barrels
             on him! Whehe is he?!

                         BRODY
             Have you eveh had one do this?

                         QUINT
                  (and he means this)
             No!

   Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and
   Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms.

   WITH HOOPEh ON THE FLY BRIDGE

   It seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint
   climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

   Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veeyah left, and duck
   undeh.

                         QUINT
             Follow him!

                         HOOPEh
             He's undeh!

   BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                         BRODY
             Thehe!
                  (points wildly)

   The barrels have suhfaced and we see the monsteh shadow
   sliding undeh the Ohcar, seemingly endless. Violent scraping
   sounds.

                         BRODY
             He's trying to sink us!

                         QUINT
                  (to Hoopeh)
             Dead astehn! Zig-zag!

   Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the
   fight of (and foh) his life.

   The Ohcar taking evasive action. But the three barrels are
   closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying
   themselves with evehy rotation of the damaged shaft.

             BRODY
     He's chasing us! I
     don't believe it.

                                           QUINT
                                   Full throttle! To poht!

   ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

   Hoopeh is jamming the throttle fohward, but the engine is
   pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels cihcle and move
   in. Quint has his rifle ready.

                         HOOPEh
                  (suddenly giving Quint
                  the wheel)
             Hold heh.

   He leaps to his gear, trying despehately to get his dart
   gun.

   Just then, the shark attacks, breaking wateh and rising oveh
   the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectohal fins, belly,
   falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fihes
   into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                         HOOPEh
                  (loading)
             Keep him thehe! Keep him!

   The Ohcar shuddehs from side to side. From Hoopeh's point of
   view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws,
   shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to
   side, trying to tear a chunk out of the vehy hull. Quint has
   reloaded and is fihing into the fish. Brody has a wicked
   pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing
   and gouging it, trying foh the eyes. The killing lust is on
   all three men.

                         QUINT
             Throttling back!

   The boat suhges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench,
   and disengages. The dohsal fin cihcles off, beginning a wide
   loop around the boat.

   The engine quivehs and dies, the boat without poweh, rolling
   half awash, a wounded victim.

   The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath
   the waves. Thehe is complete silence.

   THE THREE MEN ON DECK

   In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the
   hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and
   pops of the cooling, dying engines.

   QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

   He eyes the stehn. Huge cracks and broken timbeh testify to
   the fuhy of the attack.

                         QUINT
                  (vehy quietly, to
                  Hoopeh)
             What can that gun of youhs do?

                         HOOPEh
             Poweh head with 20 ccs of strychnine
             nitrate. If I can hit him. I can
             kill him. But I gottar be close.
             Vehy close.

                         BRODY
                  (the awful realization)
             You gottar go in the wateh...

                                                        CUT TO:

   ON DECK, LATEh

   Quint and Hoopeh are assembling the shark cage, its shiny
   bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is wohking
   too, bolting the sections togetheh.

                         HOOPEh
                  (in command now)
             Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

   The men are speaking in near whispehs, quiet in the silence
   that suhrounds them. Hoopeh is in his wet suit, adjusting
   weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stehn.

   Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

   Hoopeh climbs in though the top.

                         HOOPEh
             Take me up.

   Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hoopeh into the
   aiyah. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hoopeh crouching in
   the cage, examining it foh stresses; satisfied, he holds out
   his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it.

   CLOSE ON HOOPEh IN THE CAGE

   He examines his weapon, checking the poweh load, with the
   big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razoh
   point.

                         HOOPEh
             Loweh away, Chief.
                  (then, to Quint)
             Try and keep him off me till I'm
             undeh.

   Hoopeh inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody
   a reassuhing smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his
   teeth and checks his regulatoh. Brody steps back, and with
   Quint guiding the cage, begins lowehing it off the gin pole
   boom arm into the sear alongside the boat.

   Brody and Hoopeh stare at each anotheh as theiyah faces pass,
   Hoopeh sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

   As Hoopeh disappears beneath the suhface, Quint and Brody
   exchange a long look between them.

   UNDEhWATEh - CAGE

   HOOPEh'S POINT OF VIEW

   Submehging. The sky, hohizon, wateh line, clean fresh sear
   aiyah then... the magnificent innehspaces, with bubbles
   sparkling in front of us.

   ANGLE - HOOPEh IN THE CAGE

   as he floats to twenty feet Hoopeh neveh stops looking around
   360 degrees. He removes the rubbeh guard from the needle and
   waits.

   EXT. THE SUhFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

   Theiyah tuhning heads tell us that the barrels are still
   cihcling.

   Suddenly, both heads stop tuhning.

   THE SEA

   The barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change
   couhse and meandeh toward the lowehed cage.

   UNDEhWATEh - HOOPEh

   His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep
   and tuhns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on
   something monstrous... and fascinating.

   HOOPEh'S POINT OF VIEW

   The wateh is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in
   the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly --
   comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effoht, sinuous
   beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it tuhns, and its
   ghastly length passes right in front of him: fihst the snout,
   then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

   Hoopeh tentatively reaches out. It is too far foh the
   strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes,
   ihon scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge
   the passing cuhrents with pink.

   SUhFACE

   The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Ohcar
   above. Brody and Quint leap back.

   HOOPEh - CLOSE

   The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hoopeh,
   expecting the shark to attack out of that same genehal
   dihection, braces himself, pole extended through the bars,
   breathing fasteh, straining his eyes into the gloom and...
   we see that the shark attacking from behind him.

   The cage is sent careening. Hoopeh grabs the bars foh dear
   life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal
   jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending
   the bars like clothes hangehs. Hoopeh can't tuhn the pointed
   end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the
   non-rational attackeh as possible.

   Hoopeh is trapped.

   The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges
   again. The bleeding snout thrust deepeh into the yawing bars,
   the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hoopeh's tohso,
   the tail thrusting it fohward. Hoopeh drops the strychnine
   pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward raptuhe
   depth.

   All the shark needs is one mohe good thrust befohe separating
   Hoopeh at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hoopeh
   fumbles with the ovehhead hatch coveh, kicking up and out of
   the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad
   head won't shake loose.

   Hoopeh rushes downwards, afteh the strychnine pole.

   ANGLE - SHARK

   The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward afteh
   Hoopeh.

   Hoopeh nearly recovehs the pole. Again it slips from his
   frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.
   Hoopeh tuhns and looks up.

   The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

   SUhFACE

   One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls
   taut.

   HOOPEh - DEEP

   Tuhning to meet the monsteh which -- though held back foh a
   moment by the snarled rope -- now suhges fohward.

   SUhFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

   The Ohcar is listing dangehously aft, the ginpole bent almost
   to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul
   up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a
   hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

                         QUINT
             Let go of it!

   The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale...
   the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Ohcar, dragging
   it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the
   rope barehanded.

   UNDEhWATEh - HOOPEh

   maneuvehing downward, away from the jaws... Suddenly the
   crazed shark veehs upward foh the suhface.

   SUhFACE - QUINT

   The winch is wohking fasteh now, Quint demonically winding
   it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks
   wateh.

   Brody is hohrified. The cage is empty!

             QUINT
        (a hohrible scream)
     He's comin' up -- !

                                           BRODY
                                   He's taken him!

   MASTEh ANGLE

   The shark breaks wateh right beside the Ohcar, rising with a
   great whooshing noise. It rises vehtically, towehing ovehhead,
   blocking out the sun. The pectohal fins seem to reach fohward.
   The shark, in all of its monstrous glohy, falls onto the
   stehn of the boat with a shattehing crash, narrowly missing
   Quint and Brody. It drives the stehn undehwateh, the ocean
   pouhs in oveh the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.
   Brody floundehs backwards away from it.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   He is clinging to the mast foh dear life, as the ship begins
   to tilt to stehn, and evehything starts to break loose around
   him.

   NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE OhCA

   The giant jaws are snapping ihresistibly at evehything: great
   chunks of wood tohn out of the deck and supehstructuhe.

   Deck chaiyah, ihons, rope, gear, beehcans, bottles, Brody's
   bag, all are food foh the insatiable maw blindly chuhning
   away.

   Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at
   this ultimate violation of his tehritohy. He snatches up a
   lance and huhls himself at the shark with a wohdless bellow.

   The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a
   treachehous incline, slippehy with blood and seawateh. Quint's
   footing faltehs and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell,
   the big teeth seize him and snap.

   Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is
   clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and
   legs suddenly contoht as the shark's teeth meet across his
   tohso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body
   tumble from the shark's mouth.

   Brody sees the hohroh, hears the screams -- in his
   despehation, he tears loose one of Hoopeh's remaining aiyah
   tanks, and huhls it at the monsteh. It tumbles into the bloody
   well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel
   blocking the cruel jaws.

   The shark's head shakes even mohe violently, trying to clear
   the cold ihon, but the tank is in to stay.

   DECK OF THE OhCA, LISTING BADLY

   To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling
   deck, bracing himself in the cabin doowah to avoid pitching
   down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin,
   already a shambles.

   Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting
   weight so that the boat in now stehn down, and listing to
   the side. Wateh from the sear pouhs into the cabin.

   Anotheh lunge by the shark. The huge snout and jaws slam up
   against the doohframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

   Mohe seawateh. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the
   ship.

   Brody clambehs as far from the shark as he can, against the
   fohward wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hoopeh
   used befohe. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks
   the side window highest above the wateh, edges out onto the
   battehed bridge.

   The shark rolls around, now half in the wateh. The ship is
   sinking, the sear is not a viable altehnative. Brody climbs
   up into the flying bridge.

   The shark is still lunging and snapping. Brody is fohced to
   climb higheh and higheh as the ship slowly sinks beneath
   him.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   He scrambles foh his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-
   1 stuck thehe, seizes it.

   OVEh BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STEhN

   He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on
   the steel tanks, silveh gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth.
   He fihes. And fihes. Bullets shatteh the shark's teeth,
   punching holes in the dripping snout.

   WIDE ON THE OhCA  EXPLOSION

   With a muffled boom, the pehfect symmetry of the shark is
   suddenly blown apart in a geyseh of steel and blood as Brody's
   shot hits the pressuhized tank. A 30-foot cloud of wateh,
   steel, shark and debris covehs the sky.

   A gigantic convulsion huhls the Great White's mangled body
   into the sear. The Ohcar slowly begins to tuhn oveh in its
   death roll.

   UNDEhWATEh

   The shark's carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and
   debris.

   A shadow clouds the watehs, and the Ohcar's mass begins to
   slip into the frame.

   CLOSE - HOOPEh

   Emehging from beneath the suhface, he raises his mask, spits
   out his mouthpiece and kicks toward Brody.

   SUhFACE - BRODY AND HOOPEh

   Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, relieved the
   shark is dead, yet stunned to see Hoopeh is still alive. The
   two men share weak laughteh, which soon trails off.

                         HOOPEh
             Quint...?

                         BRODY
             No...
                  (notices something
                  O.S.)
             You think we can get back with those?

   SUhFACE - BRODY AND HOOPEh - ANOTHEh ANGLE

   They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats,
   as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the suhface.

                         BRODY
             What day is this?

                         HOOPEh
             Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I
             think.

                         BRODY
             Think the tide's with us?

                         HOOPEh
             Just keep kicking.

                         BRODY
             Y'know, I used to hate the wateh...

                         HOOPEh
             I can't imagine why.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   HIGH SHOT FROM SHOhE

   The two tiny, misehable hehoes swim ashohe as the credits
   roll.
